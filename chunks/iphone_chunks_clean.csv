Is your battery not lasting as long as it used to? Swapping it out for a new one is a snap.


###Tools Required:

 - SIM Card Eject Tool

 - Phillips #00 Screwdriver

 - Suction Handle

 - Spudger


###Parts Required:

 - iPhone 3G Battery


## Step 1
If your display glass is cracked, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's display until the whole face is covered.
This will keep glass shards contained and provide structural integrity when prying and lifting the display.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.


## Remove the bottom screws
Remove the two 3.7mm Phillips #00 screws from the dock-connector end of the iPhone.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,207
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_1,"## Remove the bottom screws
Remove the two 3.7mm Phillips #00 screws from the dock-connector end of the iPhone.


## Loosen the display
Remove the metal handle from the suction cup. It's easier and safer to grip the suction cup's base instead of the metal handle.
Be very careful when opening the iPhone so that the cables under the display are not severed.
There is a rubber gasket between the silver front bezel and black display assembly. A bit of force is required in this step to separate the iPhone's display assembly. It may help to rock the suction cup back and forth to remove the display assembly.
Use a small suction cup near the Home button to gently pull up the bottom portion of the iPhone's display assembly.
If the display assembly is too damaged to allow the suction cup to adhere, tape with a strong adhesive such as duct tape or packing tape may be used.


## Pull up the display
The display assembly is still connected to the iPhone by several cables, so don't try to remove it entirely just yet.
Rotate the display assembly up until it is at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,244
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_2,"## Pull up the display
The display assembly is still connected to the iPhone by several cables, so don't try to remove it entirely just yet.
Rotate the display assembly up until it is at an angle of approximately 45 degrees.


## Disconnect cable 1
Continue to hold the display assembly with one hand, and use your other hand and a spudger to disconnect the black ribbon cable labeled ""1"". (Cable 1 is for the display)
Be careful to insert the spudger from the left, as shown in the picture (UNDER THE RIBBON).  If you try to pry up the ribbon from the right, you could damage the ribbon connector and need to replace the display!
All connectors except the ribbon connector ""3"" mentioned in step 7 release upwards.


## Disconnect cable 2
Rotate the display assembly up until it is roughly vertical. This will allow easier access for disconnecting the remaining cables.
Use a spudger to disconnect the black ribbon cable labeled ""2"". (Cable 2 is for the capacitative touch panel)",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,223
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_3,"## Disconnect cable 3
Please note: You may find on some non-American (Chinese, European) versions of the 3G that the flip up plastic tab does not exist. In this case you would slide the ribbon cable towards the screen until it is removed. When you assemble it, you would apply pressure to the ribbon to insert it back into the ribbon ""socket.""
Some iPhones may have the connector colors reversed (black plastic tab, white connector) for connector ""3"". Make sure you're flipping up the tab properly, otherwise you may damage the connector.
Use a spudger to flip up the white plastic tab holding the ribbon cable ""3"" in place. The white tab will rotate up 90 degrees, releasing the ribbon cable.
Slide the black ribbon cable out of its connector, and remove the display assembly from the iPhone.


## Remove the SIM card tray
Insert your SIM eject tool or a paper clip into the hole next to the headphone jack.
Press down on the tool until the SIM card tray pops out.
Grasp the SIM card tray and slide it out of the iPhone.


## Disconnect cable 4
Use a spudger to disconnect the ribbon cable labeled ""4.""

Be certain that the connectors on the ribbon cables are perfectly aligned with the sockets on the mother board before applying pressure. This may require a magnifying glass or jewelers' loupe.


## Remove the logic board screws
Remove the following 8 screws:
Five 2.3 mm Phillips #00 screws with partial threads securing the logic board to the rear case.
Two 2.3 mm Phillips #00 screws with full threads securing the logic board and camera.
One 2.9 mm Phillips #00 screw from beneath the ""Do not remove"" sticker.
Note for re-assembly:
The screw that goes next to the camera (bottom right orange highlighted screw) also has a metal strip that holds the camera in place.
Remember to put this strip back in place before you insert the 2.3 mm Phillips #00 screw with full thread next to the camera",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,259
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_5,"## Loosen the camera
Use a spudger to gently pry the camera up and out of its housing in the rear case.
The camera cannot be removed entirely yet because it's connected to the bottom of the logic board.


## Remove the logic board
Use a spudger to gently pry up the end of the logic board closest to the dock connector.
There is a small golden grounding tab on logic board adjacent to the 'do not remove sticker'. Be VERY careful this does not snag on the side of the case when prying up the logic board; it breaks easily. If you have signal problems after removing the logic board, check this ground tab.
If the board won't lift up, double check to make sure all the screws securing the logic board have been removed.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,166
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_6,"## Step 14
Slide the logic board towards the dock connector and out of the iPhone.
When replacing the logic board after installing battery, connect the camera to the logic board before inserting it into the case. Then make sure to set the top section of the logic board (where the SIM tray is) in place before settling the rest of the board in place. This is important, as sometimes the SIM card slot will not align into place. Once the top section is in place, the bottom section can be maneuvered into place. You will know the logic board is correctly installed when the SIM tray is aligned with the opening in the iPhone case and the camera module seats neatly into its place.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,141
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_7,"## Loosen the battery
Use a spudger to pry the battery up from the rear case. The battery is attached with an adhesive strip around the perimeter of the battery.
To prevent the battery from bending during the removal process, we recommend against using just the plastic pull-tab.
Removing the battery is NOT necessary for replacing the GPS antenna. It merely gives you more space for removing the headphone assembly (which is also unnecessary to completely remove).
The iPhone's battery is attached to the rear case with a mild adhesive. This adhesive usually comes out attached to the battery. If your replacement battery already includes an adhesive backing, you're all set. If your replacement battery doesn't have an adhesive backing, you'll want to transfer the adhesive from your old battery to the new one.
If the battery isn't detaching from the rear case, apply a few drops of high concentration (over 90%) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery. Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive. Use the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery. Allow the alcohol to air dry before installing your new battery.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,249
iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement_8,"Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.
You can use a hair dryer or heat gun on its lowest setting to heat the back of the case. This will help loosen the adhesive bond before using the spudger to separate the battery from the case back.
Caution: Overheating the iPhone may ignite the battery.
To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",iPhone_3G_Battery_Replacement,116

Rotate the display assembly up until it is roughly vertical. This will allow easier access for disconnecting the remaining cables.
Use a spudger to disconnect the black ribbon cable labeled ""2.""


## Step 6
Ribbon cable ""3"" is held in place by a FPC style connector. You must unlock this connector before sliding the ribbon cable out. The locking mechanism is on the opposite side of where the cable is inserted - it swivels upwards 90 degrees. Use a plastic spudger to lift the locking mechanism.
The FPC locking latch is very delicate and is typically a different color than the body of the connector. (see the detail image of FPC connector open and closed)
Slide the ribbon cable out of the connector, and remove the display assembly from the iPhone.
It's impossible to properly reinsert a ribbon into an FPC connector unless the lock is disengaged. Make sure the locking latch is open when attaching/detaching the cable.

Remove the four Phillips #00 screws securing the volume and mute switch.
The volume switch assembly sits on top of the mute switch. Make sure that the small soft pad on the mute switch is not lost, otherwise the mute switch will sit very loosely after reassembly.
The mute switch assembly screws should be tightened with the switch in the off position. Check the protrusion of the switch when turned on, since it may not stick out far enough to operate if the switch assembly is incorrectly positioned. (Check the gap between the switch frame and the bezel (white gap showing between the two screws near the 6). The screw on the far right is slightly longer than the other 3 screws. When reassembling the phone, keep this in mind.

## Step 1
If your display glass is cracked, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's display until the whole face is covered.
This will keep glass shards contained and provide structural integrity when prying and lifting the display.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.


## Step 1
Remove the two Phillips #00 screws from the dock-connector end of the iPhone.
Make sure to keep all the screws organized as you are taking the phone apart. They are different sizes.",iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement,212
iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement_4,"## Step 7
Remove the single Phillips #00 screw from the corner of the display assembly.


## Step 8
Remove the two Phillips #00 screws from the right side of the display assembly.


## Step 9
Turn the display around, and if there is a thin strip of black tape on the edge of the display assembly, carefully peel it up.
Keeping the tape from sticking to itself can be tricky. We recommend placing the tape on a wax-coated piece of paper (any sticker backing will do).


## Step 10
Remove the three Phillips #00 screws from the left side of the display assembly.


## Step 11
Turn the display assembly over and again carefully insert a metal spudger between the two metal rails along the edge of the display assembly. Gently rotate the spudger to lift the LCD up from the glass.


## Step 12
Separate the LCD and glass by sliding the LCD panel away from the ribbon cables on the glass.


## Step 1
This is what should be left after removing the LCD.",iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement,212
iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement_5,"## Step 12
Separate the LCD and glass by sliding the LCD panel away from the ribbon cables on the glass.


## Step 1
This is what should be left after removing the LCD.


## Step 2
Be careful when using a heat gun in the forthcoming steps. Use it at a very low heat setting, and make sure not to melt the touch screen plastics or Home button. The metal frame tends to conduct heat very well so try to avoid touching these hot areas.
If the glass has shattered at the top or bottom be especially patient and gentle when removing fragments.  In extreme cases you may have to pick off any glass shards that remain glued to the plastics.
Using a heat gun or hairdryer, heat the top left area of the touch screen.
Use your fingernails to slowly lift up the left corner. The touch screen plastics are held to the touch screen with adhesive. It may take some work to free the corners.
If it seems like too much force is being applied to lift the touch screen plastics, try using the heat gun again.
Heat and repeat for the right side.


## Step 3
Once the top is free, use the heat gun to heat the sides of the touch screen.
Use a spudger to free the sides of the touch screen plastics.",iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement,259
iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement_6,"## Step 3
Once the top is free, use the heat gun to heat the sides of the touch screen.
Use a spudger to free the sides of the touch screen plastics.


## Step 4
Heat the bottom corners with the heat gun.
Again, use your fingernails to free the corners.
Remove the touch screen plastics from the touch screen.


## Step 5
In order to adhere the new panel, peel as much of the existing adhesive off of the front panel frame as you can.
This will ensure a better fit and ensure good attachment of the new adhesive.


## Step 6
Place [product|IF137-006|custom fit adhesive strips] or double stick tape on the upper area of the front panel plastics.
Use the flat end of a spudger to press the adhesive strips to the plastic frame.
This will clear out bubbles and ensure good adhesion.


## Step 7
Place the second adhesive strip or double stick tape on the home button end of the front panel frame.
Run the flat end of a spudger over the strip to stick it down and push bubbles out from under the sticker.",iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement,236
iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement_7,"## Step 8
Using the tip of a spudger to start, peel the adhesive backings off of the strips on the front panel plastic.
The adhesive backing is fairly thin, be sure you are only peeling up the backing and not the adhesive itself.


## Step 9
Peel the protective plastic off of the inside of the front panel glass.
There are three separate pieces: be sure to peel up the '''home button piece''', '''center glass piece''' and the '''piece under the cables'''. Failure to peel these up could mean poor adhesion and a murky screen.
Try not to touch the inside of the glass to avoid putting fingerprints between the display glass layers.


## Step 10
Fold the front panel cables down toward the home button recess to get them out of the way.
The cable labeled as ""#2"" should lay as shown when you merge the two pieces of the front panel.


## Step 11
Ensuring that the upper cables are folded clear, align the top of the front glass with the front panel frame.


## Step 12
Press the front panel and front panel frame together, ensuring the the home button ends are aligned.",iPhone_3G_Front_Panel_Replacement,249

iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_4,"## Anti-Clamp instructions
The next two steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down two steps for an alternate method.***
For complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].
Pull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.
Slide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.
Position the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone just above the home button—one on the front, and one on the back.
Squeeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.
If the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use the included tape pad|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,221
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_5,"## Step 5
Pull the blue handle forwards to lock the arms.
Turn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch.
Make sure the suction cups [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BSluctHhVVqhGtfj.full|new_window=true|remain aligned with each other]. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.
Insert an opening pick under the screen when the Anti-Clamp creates a large enough gap.
If the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, rotate the handle a quarter turn.
***Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time and wait a few seconds between turns***. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you.
***Skip the next two steps.***


## Manual Opening Procedure
If you don't have an Anti-Clamp, use a single suction cup to lift the front panel:
Press a suction cup onto the screen, just above the home button.
Be sure the cup is completely on the screen to get a tight seal.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,257
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_6,"## Start lifting the front panel assembly
The front panel is attached with clips, and there are several ribbon cables connecting it to the rest of the phone. Your goal here is to release the clips and '''open the phone only enough to disconnect the cables'''. Go slowly and carefully to avoid damage.
Make sure the suction cup is firmly attached to the front panel assembly near the home button.
While holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the home button end of the front panel from the rear case.
With a plastic opening tool, gently pry the edges of the rear case down, away from the front panel assembly, while you pull up with the suction cup.
Take your time and apply firm, constant force. The front panel assembly is a much tighter fit than on most other devices.


## Step 8
Do not try to completely remove the front panel assembly from the rear case, as there are several delicate ribbon cables connecting them.
Pull the plastic nub to release the vacuum seal on the suction cup.
Remove the suction cup from the screen.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,231
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_7,"## Removing the Touch ID cable bracket
Open the phone just enough to reveal the metal bracket covering the home button cable.
Do not open the phone too far or you risk damaging the home button cable, or the socket it plugs into. ***Keep the cable loose—if it is stretched taut, that's too far.***
Only the phone's original home button assembly will be capable of using the Touch ID functionality. ***If you rip the cable, installing a new home button will only restore ordinary home button functions, not the Touch ID features.***
Use the tip of a spudger to push the bracket free and remove it with [product|IF145-020|tweezers].
The next two steps apply to reassembly. Skip them and continue to Step 12 until reassembly.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,179
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_8,"## Step 10
During reassembly, you will need to reinstall the Touch ID cable bracket. The top of the bracket needs to slide between the battery and Touch ID cable connector, in front of the metal tab. The bottom must latch down over the connector.
Slide the top of the bracket over the Touch ID cable connector from left to right.
Alternatively, lay the bracket directly over the connector. The edge with the ""leg"" will prop the bracket up at a slight angle, and the opposite edge must be between the cable connector and the metal tab near the battery. With the edge of a spudger flat against the bracket, apply gentle downward pressure to snap in the back and front clasps.


## Step 11
During reassembly, use the flat end of a spudger to snap the front portion of the Touch ID cable bracket down over the cable connector.
If the bracket does not snap down flush, you may need to remove the bracket and slide it over the cable connector again for a better fit.


## Disconnecting the home button cable connector
Use the tip of a spudger to pry the home button cable connector up out of its socket.
Be sure you're separating the cable connector from its socket, and not prying the entire socket up. The socket is on its own glued-down cable that can be pried up if you aren't careful.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,288
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_9,"## Opening up the phone
Once the connector has been released, pull the home button end of the assembly away from the rear case, using the top of the phone as a hinge.
Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.
Add a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.
In a pinch, you can use an unopened canned beverage to hold the display.


## Step 14
Remove the two 1.6 mm Phillips #000 screws securing the metal battery connector bracket to the logic board.


## Step 15
Remove the metal battery connector bracket from the iPhone.


## Step 16
Use the flat end of a spudger to gently pry the battery connector up from its socket on the logic board.
Be very careful to only pry up on the battery connector itself and not the socket on the logic board. If you pry up on the logic board socket or the board itself, you may destroy the socket or damage nearby components on the board.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,229
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_10,"## Step 17
Remove the following screws securing the front panel assembly cable bracket to the logic board:
One 1.7 mm Phillips #000 screw
One 1.2 mm Phillips #000 screw
One 1.3 mm Phillips #000 screw
One more 1.7 mm Phillips #000 screw
This 1.7 mm screw tends to not be attracted to a magnetized screwdriver. Take care not to lose it when removing.
It is especially important to keep track of your screws in this step for reassembly. Accidentally using the 1.3 mm screw or one of the 1.7 mm screws in the bottom right hole will result in significant damage to the logic board causing the phone to no longer boot properly.
Be careful not to [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Screwdriver+Best+Practices/25630#s64986|over-tighten] the screws, and don't force them. If they don't fit easily when you are securing them, they may be the wrong size.


## Step 18
Remove the front panel assembly cable bracket from the logic board.


## Step 19
Use a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the front-facing camera and sensor cable.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,261

## Step 19
Use a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the front-facing camera and sensor cable.


## Step 20
Make sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cable in this step.
Disconnect the LCD cable connector.
When reassembling your phone, the LCD cable may pop off the connector. This can result in white lines or a blank screen when powering your phone back on. If that happens, simply reconnect the cable and power cycle your phone. The best way to power cycle your phone is to disconnect and reconnect the battery.


## Step 21
Finally, disconnect the digitizer cable connector.


## Step 22
Remove the front panel assembly from the rear case.


## Step 1
Remove the two screws securing the upper component bracket:
4.0 mm Phillips #000
2.3 mm Phillips #000
It is imperative that the right screws are inserted into their respective holes. Otherwise it may cause severe damage to the LCD during reassembly.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,235
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_12,"## Step 2
Orient the phone as shown, with the home button on top and the earpiece speaker on bottom.
Gently dislodge the clip, near the bottom left corner of the earpiece speaker bracket, outwards from its recess on the front panel assembly.
Do ***not*** pry with excessive force, as the earpiece speaker bracket is fragile and malleable.
With a set of [product|IF145-020|tweezers], shift the bracket to the left to unclip it.


## Step 3
Remove the bracket from the display.


## Step 4
Remove the earpiece speaker with a set of tweezers.
If you use your fingers, be very careful not to touch the gold contacts on the front panel. Finger oil can prevent good contact.


## Step 5
To replace the earpiece speaker, it is easiest to install the speaker and bracket together:
Place the earpiece speaker bracket over the speaker so that it fits snugly in its housing.
Slide the left hook of the bracket into the notch above the top left corner of the front facing camera.
Rotate the bracket so it lays flat on the rear case, aligning the two screw holes. Press the bracket into place, ensuring the hook on the right side of the metal bracket latches onto the display.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,274
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_13,"## Step 1
This step requires removing the front facing camera and sensor cable from your front panel assembly.
The front facing camera and sensor cable is adhered to the display assembly with mild adhesive.
Using an [product|IF145-198|iOpener] to soften the adhesive will help safely remove it. [guide|11677|Follow our iOpener instructions] to use it.


## Step 2
Using the edge of a set of [product|IF145-020|tweezers] or a metal spudger, gently pry the earpiece speaker contact cable up, to separate this portion of the camera and sensor cable from the adhesive below.
***Only pry directly under the earpiece speaker contacts***—there are sensors and microchips that can be damaged by prying elsewhere.


## Step 3
Use the point of a spudger to lift the ambient light sensor and proximity sensor out of their recess in the display assembly.
There is a small, square plastic and metal holder for the proximity sensor. This holder is essential for the proximity sensor to function correctly.
If replacing the proximity sensor make sure that the holder remains adhered to the back of the display. If it comes off with the old proximity sensor, remove it from the old sensor and use a tiny bit of adhesive to re-attach it to the back of the display.",iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement,290
iPhone_5s_LCD_and_Digitizer_Replacement_14,"## Step 4
Use the flat end of a spudger to gently peel the front-facing camera portion of the cable away from the display assembly.


## Step 5
If you are reattaching the same shield plate to a new display, there is no need to peel the cable assembly off the LCD shield plate. Skip this step.
Carefully peel the cable assembly off of the LCD shield plate to remove it from the display.
Be careful not to grab the digitizer cable while peeling up the front facing camera and sensor assembly cable.


## Step 1
Unscrew the single captive Phillips #000 screw securing the home button cable.
The captive screw is fastened to the home button cable by a spring contact backing. During reassembly, ensure the contact is in the correct orientation—on the side of the screw nearest the LCD.
If your replacement part does not have this captive screw and spring contact, you will need to transfer them to the new cable.


## Step 2
Fold the home button cable down, out of the way of the home button bracket.


## Step 3
Remove the two 1.4 mm Phillips #000 screws from the home button bracket.


## Step 4

## Step 4
Remove the home button bracket from the display assembly.


## Step 5
Wedge the the tip of a spudger underneath the home button cable assembly.
The home button cable is affixed by mild adhesive.
Gently work the spudger underneath the cable to separate the home button cable from the front panel assembly.
Do '''not''' remove the home button yet, as it is still attached to the front panel assembly.


## Step 6
If necessary, remove the tape over the home button on the front side of your cracked front panel assembly.
Gently push the top left corner of the home button up away from the front panel.
Do '''not''' push the home button all the way through—you only need to get a corner free, so that you can pry it free with a spudger.
This membrane is very thin. If you feel like you're going to tear the button, apply heat and try again.


## Step 7
Peel the home button the rest of the way off of the display by prying gently with a spudger.

"iPhone_5s,_5c,_and_SE_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_2","## Step 1
Before installing new adhesive strips, temporarily connect your new battery and check its alignment in the iPhone.
If everything looks good, disconnect the battery and remove it.


## Step 2
Peel off the large blue film liner and remove it from the adhesive strips completely.
Take care not to accidentally touch the adhesive strips after this step. The adhesive is good for one use. If it sticks to your finger or another surface accidentally, it must be discarded and replaced.
The blue film sometimes has a defect that prevents it from peeling off, and the strips have to be discarded and replaced.
If this happens to you and you got your strips from iFixit, [http://help.ifixit.com/category/133-contact-ifixit|contact us here|new_window=true] and we'll send you a replacement on the double.
In the meantime, you can temporarily reassemble your iPhone with a bit of double-sided tape to hold the battery.

iPhone_5s_Power_Button_Replacement_1,"## Taping the display glass
If your display glass is cracked, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's display until the whole face is covered.
This will keep glass shards contained and provide structural integrity when prying and lifting the display.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.


## Display separation prevention
In the following steps you will be pulling the display up out of the phone body. The display is composed of a glass screen and a plastic bezel with metal clips.
Regardless of the tool you use, '''you need to be sure you pull up the entire display'''.
If the glass begins to separate from the plastic, as shown in the first image, slide a plastic opening tool between the plastic frame and the metal phone body to pry the metal clips out of the case.
If you are reassembling a phone with a separated display bezel, you may want to place a thin strip of adhesive between the plastic bezel and the glass to keep the phone closed.",iPhone_5s_Power_Button_Replacement,233

Using a set of  [product|IF145-020|tweezers], gently peel the gasket off of the home button.
The gasket is ***very*** thin; if you feel it begin to tear, stop peeling and apply heat before proceeding.


## Step 2
Thread the gasket off of the ribbon cable.
Removing the gasket over the home button risks stretching or cutting the thin gasket.

You probably know “righty-tighty, lefty-loosey,” but we’ve rounded up a few additional tips to help you perfect your screwdriver technique and avoid the wrath of the stripped screw.

If you found this page just a bit too late, twirl on over to our [guide|13213|stripped screw removal guide].

 - Mako Driver Kit - 64 Precision Bits

 - Essential Electronics Tool Kit

 - Repair Business Toolkit

 - Manta Driver Kit - 112 Bit Driver Kit

Screwdriver_Best_Practices_1,"## Driver Selection
Different screw heads call for different driver types. Whether it be Phillips, Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS), Pozidrive, Torx, Triwing, or plain old Flathead, use the correct driver for your application.
Using a driver that’s “close enough”—such as by turning a Phillips screw with a Flathead driver—can sometimes get you out of a bind, but mostly it’s a recipe for trouble.
What’s that, you say? That sounds like a lot of drivers to keep track of? Try using a set of interchangeable bits, like the [product|IF145-299|64 Bit Kit|new_window=true] for electronics repair or the [product|IF145-392|Universal Bit Kit|new_window=true] for larger applications.",Screwdriver_Best_Practices,174
Screwdriver_Best_Practices_2,"## Size Selection
A correctly sized driver should “fill up” the screw head, utilizing both the full depth and width of the socket.
Beginners commonly make the mistake of using a driver that’s too small. An undersized driver slips easily, damaging the screw head and making it difficult to turn afterward—even with a correctly-sized driver. This is known as a ''stripped screw''.
An oversized driver fits into the screw only shallowly, if at all.
When you find a driver that fits about right, compare the next size up as well as the next size down before you proceed.
In general, use the largest driver size that fits snugly into the screw.


## Proper Use
Keep your drivers in good working condition by using them only as designed.
Avoid using screwdrivers as improvised pry tools or chisels.
Prying with a screwdriver can bend or break the tip, making it useless for turning screws.
Chiseling with a driver can deform the tip. A damaged driver like this one no longer fits snugly in the screw head, resulting in slippage (and stripped screws).
To avoid stripping screws, only use drivers that are in good condition.",Screwdriver_Best_Practices,254
Screwdriver_Best_Practices_3,"## Step 4
Use ''continuous downward pressure'' to keep the driver tip in contact with the screw.
A limp grip or a lack of pressure will cause the driver to simply slip out of the screw head instead of turning the screw.


## Step 5
Keep the driver directly in line with the screw, with the shaft directly over the screw head. The driver and screw should be “on-axis,” forming a straight line.
Holding the driver at an angle creates a poor fit between the driver and the screw head. Result: slippage and probable damage to the screw.
Sometimes the screw itself needs to go into the surface at an angle. Keep the driver positioned correctly relative to the screw, rather than the surface it’s going into.


## Step 6
Whenever you install a screw, first turn the screw counter-clockwise (in the “loosey” direction) to “seat” the screw.
Turn slowly until you feel the screw level off and sink slightly, then stop.
Now it's safe to tighten the screw.
A properly installed screw will turn easily until it's fully tight.
An improperly threaded screw gets increasingly difficult to tighten—because the misaligned threads are cutting across the threads in the screw hole, causing permanent damage. This is known as ""cross-threading.""
If your screw doesn't tighten easily, back off and carefully re-seat it, and try again.",Screwdriver_Best_Practices,291
Screwdriver_Best_Practices_4,"## Step 7
Finally, use appropriate torque when tightening screws down. A properly fastened screw will be snug, but not so tight that your driver starts to slip.
This is largely a matter of feel, so your technique will improve with practice.
Smaller screws generally require less torque; over tightening them can damage their threads.
Very small screws—such as those used in phones and tablets—require very little tightening force. As soon as you feel resistance, give it another quarter turn or less and then stop.",Screwdriver_Best_Practices,108

Insert an iPod opening tool in the gap between the antenna cover and the front bezel. The wedge of the tool should be pointing towards the antenna cover. Slide the tool around the corner and up until you reach the metal backing.
Repeat the same procedure on the other side of the dock connector.


## Step 4
Grasp the antenna cover on either side and slide it up and away from the iPhone. This requires some force. If it does not come free, ensure that the antenna cover is lifted up enough to free the catches.


## Step 1
Remove the three Phillips #00 screws securing the rear panel to the iPhone.


## Step 2
Getting the iPhone open is a challenging feat, so don't get discouraged. Take a deep breath and make sure you have plenty of time to get the job done.
The small square hole is the location to insert the dental pick in the next step.


## Step 3

Use a spudger to disconnect the headphone jack cable from the logic board.


## Step 1
Use the tip of a spudger to remove the cloudy white glue covering the battery contacts.
To reduce the risk of shorting the red battery lead to the metal shield, you can first remove the glue from the black and white battery leads. After desoldering the black and white leads, then remove the glue and desolder the red lead.",iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement,116
iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement_4,"## Step 2
Working from the edge opposite the battery connectors, insert a spudger between the battery and the plastic frame and pry up. The battery is attached to the casing with an adhesive, but should slowly come free.
If the battery isn't coming free, apply a few drops of high concentration (over 90%) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery.
Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive.
Use the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.
If there's any alcohol solution remaining in the phone, carefully wipe it off or allow it to air dry before continuing.",iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement,180
iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement_5,"## Step 3
If you have never soldered before, we have a [guide|750|guide] that makes it easy to learn. We suggest brushing up before proceeding.
We're now ready to begin the soldering process. You'll need a soldering iron, solder, and desoldering wick. You should be able to find these items at a Radio Shack if you don't already have them.
Clean the solding iron by melting a small amount of solder directly onto the soldering iron's tip and then wiping the tip of the soldering iron on a damp sponge.


## Step 4
Place the desoldering wick on top of the existing solder ball.
Place the soldering iron on top of wick above the existing solder ball.
Hold the soldering iron in place until the solder melts into the wick.
Repeat the same procedure on the remaining two connectors.
Lift the old battery out of the iPhone. Be sure that all the solder has been removed before pulling the wires away from the board. The wires should come free with little to no resistance.",iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement,232
iPhone_1st_Generation_Battery_Replacement_6,"## Step 5
We recommend that you clean the exposed surface of the board with a soft cloth or sponge and a small amount of rubbing alcohol.
Melt a small solder bead directly onto the metal connector on the board by placing the soldering iron onto the metal connector and then pressing solder against the tip and the board.
Once a small amount of solder has melted onto the board, lift the solder away first and then the soldering iron.


## Step 6
The solder bead should look like a small dome or hemisphere. If it is flat or jagged, simply place the soldering iron back on the solder to re-melt it and then pull the soldering iron away. It may require a little more solder if this does not work.


## Step 7
Attach the red lead first, followed by the white lead, and finish with the black lead.
Place the wire from the new battery onto the new solder bead.
Press the tip of the soldering iron onto the solder bead until it melts.
Slide the wire lead into the liquid solder until it is in the center of the bead, then remove the soldering iron.
Continue with the other two connections the same way, taking special care not to solder two of the connectors together.

Close the handle on the iSclack, opening the suction-cup jaws.
Place the bottom of your iPhone in between the suction cups, against the plastic depth gauge.
The top suction cup should rest just above the home button.
Open the handles to close the jaws of the iSclack. Center the suction cups and press them firmly onto the top and bottom of the iPhone.",iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement,256
iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement_2,"## Finishing the iSclack Opening Procedure
Hold onto your iPhone securely and close the handle of the iSclack to separate the suction cups, pulling the front panel up from the rear case.
The iSclack is designed to safely open your iPhone just enough to separate the pieces, but not enough to damage any cables.
Peel the two suction cups off your iPhone.
'''Skip the next three steps and continue on to [guide|21068|Step 8|stepid=58233].'''


## Manual Opening Procedure
Press a suction cup onto the screen, just above the home button.
Be sure the cup is completely on the screen to get a tight seal.


## Start lifting the front panel assembly
Make sure the suction cup is firmly attached to the front panel assembly.
While holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the front panel assembly from the rear case.
Take your time and apply firm, constant force. The display assembly is a much tighter fit than most devices.
With a plastic opening tool, begin to gently pry the rear case down, away from the display assembly, while you pull up with the suction cup.
There are several clips attaching the front panel assembly to the rear case, so you may need to use a combination of the suction cup and plastic opening tool to free the front panel assembly.",iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement,289
iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement_3,"## Step 7
Pull the plastic nub to release the vacuum seal on the suction cup.
Remove the suction cup from the display assembly.


## Opening up the phone
Lift the home button end of the front panel up to gain access to the connectors near the top of the phone.
Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.
In a pinch, you can use an unopened canned beverage to hold the display.
Add a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.


## Step 9
Remove the two 1.6 mm Phillips #000 screws securing the metal battery connector bracket to the logic board.


## Step 10
Remove the metal battery connector bracket from the iPhone.


## Disconnecting the battery connector
Use a spudger or a clean fingernail to gently pry the battery connector up from its socket on the logic board.
Be very careful to only pry up on the battery connector itself and not the socket on the logic board. If you pry up on the logic board socket or the board itself, you may destroy the socket or damage nearby components on the board.",iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement,256
iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement_4,"## Step 12
Remove the following  Phillips #000 screws securing the front panel assembly cable bracket to the logic board:
Two 1.3 mm screws
One 1.7 mm screw
One 3.25 mm screw
It is especially important to keep track of your screws in this step for reassembly. Accidentally using the 3.25 mm screw or the 1.7 mm screw in the '''bottom right''' hole will result in significant damage to the logic board causing the phone to no longer boot properly.
Be careful not to over-tighten the screws. If they don't fit easily when you are securing them, they may be the wrong size—don't force them.


## Step 13
Remove the front panel assembly cable bracket from the logic board.


## Disconnecting the front panel assembly cables
Use a plastic opening tool or a fingernail to disconnect the front-facing camera and sensor cable connector.
Be sure to '''only''' pry up on the connector, and not on the socket on the logic board.",iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement,221
iPhone_5c_Home_Button_Replacement_5,"## Step 15
Make sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cables in this step.
Use a plastic opening tool or a fingernail to disconnect the LCD cable connector.
The LCD and Digitizer connectors are on the same cable assembly, so prying the LCD connector up should disconnect both connectors. Double check that the two cables are fully disconnected before removing the display.
When reassembling your phone, the LCD cable may pop off its connector. A blank screen, or white lines on the display could be caused by a loose connection. Should this happen, reconnect the cable and power cycle your phone. The best way to power cycle your phone is to disconnect and reconnect the battery.

## Step 2
Use a plastic opening tool to pry the edge of the home button ribbon cable up from the display assembly.
Start under the contact points on the right and work to the left.
Starting from the left and going right may rip your ribbon cable. The contacts are well adhered to the front panel and should be peeled up first.
If you have trouble sliding the plastic opening tool under the contact points, flip the tool over and gently push against the right side of the contact cable to loosen the adhesive, then try again.


## Step 3
Remove the home button ribbon cable from the display assembly.
If you're installing a new home button ribbon cable, be sure to keep the metal bracket and transfer it to your new ribbon cable during reassembly.


## Step 1
Gently push the top right corner of the home button up away from the front panel.
Do not push the home button all the way through; you only need to get a corner free so that you can pry it out with a spudger.

iPhone_6_Logic_Board_Replacement_3,"## Manual Opening Procedure
If you don't have an [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], use a single suction cup to lift the front panel:
Press a suction cup onto the screen, just above the home button.
Be sure the cup is pressed securely onto the screen to get a tight seal.
If your display is badly cracked, [guide|103486|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|stepid=193571|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen.


## Step 2
While holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the front panel assembly from the rear case.
Take your time and apply firm, constant force. The display assembly is a much tighter fit than most devices.
Using a plastic opening tool, begin to gently pry the rear case down, away from the display assembly, while continuing to pull up with the suction cup.
There are several clips holding the front panel assembly to the rear case, so you may need to use a combination of the suction cup and plastic opening tool to free the front panel assembly.",iPhone_6_Logic_Board_Replacement,277
iPhone_6_Logic_Board_Replacement_4,"## Step 3
Pull the plastic nub to release the vacuum seal on the suction cup.
Remove the suction cup from the display assembly.


## Opening up the phone
Open the iPhone by swinging the home button end of the front panel assembly away from the rear case, using the top of the phone as a hinge.
Several clips along the top edge of the front panel form a partial hinge.
During reassembly, align the clips just below the top edge of the rear case. Then, slide the front panel upward until its top edge is flush with that of the rear case.


## Step 5
Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.
In a pinch, an unopened canned beverage works well for this.
Add a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.",iPhone_6_Logic_Board_Replacement,197

Before disassembling your iPhone, discharge the battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 3.6 mm P2 Pentalobe screws next to the Lightning connector.


## Anti-Clamp instructions
The next two steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method.***
For complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].
Pull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.
Slide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.
Position the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone just above the home button—one on the front, and one on the back.
Squeeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.
If you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use tape|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.",iPhone_6_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement,291
iPhone_6_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement_8,"## Step 5
The rubber gasket surrounding the home button is very thin and tears easily.
Apply mild heat (with an [product|IF145-198-2|iOpener], heat gun, or hair dryer) to soften the adhesive securing the home button gasket.
Using your fingertip, gently press up on the home button from the front side of the display assembly. Use firm, constant pressure to slowly separate the home button's rubber gasket from the front panel.


## Step 6
Carefully use the tip of a spudger to finish separating the home button from the front panel.

## Step 1
Peel back the first battery adhesive tab from the bottom right edge of the battery.
Use your fingers or [product|IF145-020-4|blunt tweezers]. Be extra careful when working near the battery; puncturing a lithium-ion battery can release dangerous chemicals and cause a fire.",iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement,84
iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement_8,"## Step 2
Try to keep the strips flat and unwrinkled during this procedure; wrinkled strips will stick together and break instead of pulling out cleanly.
Very slowly, pull and stretch one adhesive strip away from the battery, toward the bottom of the iPhone.
Allow the strip to stretch out before pulling any harder. If you can't feel it stretching, ease up, or it will break.
Pull at as low of an angle as you can without snagging the adhesive strip on any of the components along the lower edge of the phone.
Don't press down on the battery as you pull the strip.
The strip will stretch to many times its original length. Continue pulling slowly until it releases and slips out from underneath the battery.
If the battery adhesive tabs break during the removal process, use your fingers or blunt tweezers to retrieve the remaining length of adhesive, and continue pulling.
If any of the adhesive strips break underneath the battery and cannot be retrieved, try to remove the remaining strips, and then  '''[guide|29424|proceed as instructed below|stepid=69623]'''.",iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement,239
iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement_9,"## Step 3
Peel back the second battery adhesive tab from the other side of the battery.
Again, pull and slowly stretch the adhesive tab to slide it out from between the battery and the rear case.
Continue pulling the adhesive tab until it releases completely from the battery. If it breaks, try to retrieve the remaining length and continue pulling, or proceed as instructed below.",iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement,79
iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement_10,"## Step 4
Peel back the final battery adhesive tab from the bottom edge of the battery. Gently pull the battery adhesive tab upward and away from the battery, allowing the adhesive strip to slowly slide out from between the battery and the rear case.
Place one hand over the battery as the final strip comes out, or it may fling the battery out of the iPhone.
Continue pulling until the final strip comes free from the iPhone.
If you removed all three adhesive strips successfully, continue to '''step 24'''. Otherwise, if the adhesive breaks off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, apply a few drops of high concentration (over 90%) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery in the area of the broken adhesive strip(s).
Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive. Use the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.",iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement,236
iPhone_6_Plus_Audio_Control_and_Rocker_Switch_Cable_Replacement_11,"Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.

Make sure the suction cups [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/BSluctHhVVqhGtfj.full|new_window=true|remain aligned with each other]. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.
Insert an opening pick under the screen when the Anti-Clamp creates a large enough gap.
If the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, rotate the handle a quarter turn.
***Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time***, and wait a few seconds between turns. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you.
***Skip the next three steps.***


## Step 1
If you don't have an [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], follow the next three steps to use a suction handle.
Apply mild heat to the lower edge of the iPhone using an [guide|25705|iOpener] or hair dryer for about a minute.
Heat softens the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open.",iPhone_6s_Battery_Replacement,286
iPhone_6s_Battery_Replacement_5,"## Step 2
Opening the display on the 6s separates a thin strip of adhesive around the perimeter of the display. If you prefer to replace the adhesive, have a set of new adhesive strips ready before you continue. It's possible to complete the repair without replacing the adhesive, and you probably won't notice any difference in functionality.
Apply a suction cup to the lower left corner of the display assembly.
Take care '''not''' to place the suction cup over the home button.
If your display is badly cracked, [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Taping+Over+The+Display/103486|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere.

Use this guide to correctly apply replacement adhesive under your iPhone's display after a repair. Replacing the adhesive can help maintain your iPhone's water resistance. The pre-cut adhesive strips are very delicate and are easily damaged if not applied correctly, so you may want to have a spare on hand if following this guide for the first time.

Be sure you purchase adhesive that matches the color of your display to maintain the original look of the phone.

This procedure applies to iPhone models ***6s and newer*** (earlier models don't use adhesive).

Before you begin, you should have already removed your iPhone's display assembly and set it aside. If not, return to your specific iPhones repair guide and follow it until you're ready to reinstall the display assembly.

Begin by removing all the old display adhesive around the perimeter of your iPhone's case.
You can pull the adhesive off with [product|IF145-020|tweezers], or roll it up on the tip of a spudger with a roll-and-pull motion.


## Step 2
Use the tip of your spudger to remove any remaining smaller bits of adhesive.


## Step 3
If you're reinstalling your existing display rather than replacing it with a new one, be sure to remove any remaining adhesive from the back of your display as well.


## Step 4
Using a lint-free cloth (or coffee filter) with a bit of isopropyl alcohol, clean the areas of the case and rear display where you removed the old adhesive.
For best results, swipe your cleaning cloth in one direction, not back and forth.
This will help remove any remaining adhesive residue and prep the surface for the new adhesive.


## Step 5
Begin peeling  the large backing from your replacement adhesive, starting from the bottom edge.
You'll usually find a large tab of some kind on the bottom edge.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,248
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_2,"## Step 5
Begin peeling  the large backing from your replacement adhesive, starting from the bottom edge.
You'll usually find a large tab of some kind on the bottom edge.


## Step 6
Before applying the adhesive, make sure your iPhone's battery connector lays flat so it doesn't press against the blue release liner. It's okay to temporarily reconnect the battery if needed—just be sure to disconnect it again before installing the display.
Carefully align the exposed lower edge of the adhesive strip with the bottom edge of your iPhone's case.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed lower adhesive strip into place.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,171
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_3,"## Step 7
Continue peeling away the backing from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place from the bottom of your iPhone to the top.
If you correctly aligned the lower edge of the adhesive, the side and top edges will fall perfectly into place. If the adhesive is misaligned, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Finish separating the adhesive backing and discard it.


## Step 9
Use the tip of a spudger to press all the adhesive into place around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Be careful not to press on the camera or other internal components.


## Step 10
Use the flat edge of your spudger to press the adhesive into place at all four corners of your iPhone.


## Step 11
Grab the small pull tab (located at one of the corners) and peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
On some versions, this liner may consist of up to four smaller pieces rather than a large single piece.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,264
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_4,"## Step 12
Completely separate the front adhesive liner(s) and discard it.
At this point you may still have very thin strips of release liner covering all of the adhesive, which prevents it from accidentally sticking to anything while you begin reassembling your iPhone. Don't remove these small release liners just yet.


## Step 13
Refer to your iPhone's display replacement guide in order to:
Reconnect all display cables
Reconnect the battery
Reinstall the cable connector cover brackets, and secure their screws.
This is a good time to power on your iPhone and test all functions before you seal the display in place. Be sure to power your iPhone back down completely before you continue.


## Step 14
'''iPhone 7 / 7 Plus only:''' Before installing your display, check the condition of the black gaskets on the two small screw bosses on the bottom edge of your display, near the home button.
If the gaskets are misaligned, use tweezers to carefully recenter them.
iPhone 6s and 6s Plus models don't have these gaskets.


## Step 15
While supporting the display, use tweezers to begin peeling off the final release liners, exposing the adhesive.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,263
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_5,"## Step 15
While supporting the display, use tweezers to begin peeling off the final release liners, exposing the adhesive.


## Step 16
Continue removing the release liner from the entire perimeter of the iPhone.
Take care not to touch the exposed adhesive.


## Step 17
The release liner may consist of two or more pieces. As you remove the final piece, you may need to pause and reposition the display.


## Step 18
Hold the display out of the way as you remove the final piece of release liner.


## Step 19
Carefully align the top edge of the display with the top edge of the phone body.
Position the display so that the tabs along the top edge fit into place just underneath the top edge of the iPhone's case.


## Step 20
Before closing up the display, check to make sure that all cables are clear.
If any cables get pinched between the edge of the display and the body of the iPhone, they may be damaged beyond repair.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,204
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_6,"## Step 20
Before closing up the display, check to make sure that all cables are clear.
If any cables get pinched between the edge of the display and the body of the iPhone, they may be damaged beyond repair.


## Step 21
As you lower the display into place, apply gentle pressure against the display's bottom edge so that the top edge stays flush with the top edge of the iPhone.
This also prevents the [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/nenhRt2JwWB41lAC|two small gaskets near the home button|new_window=true] from scraping against the iPhone's lower edge.
Press on the sides of the display near the top of the iPhone, and work your way down to click the display into place.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,176
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_7,"## Step 22
In order for the adhesive to bond correctly, you'll need to apply even pressure around the perimeter of your iPhone. The camera bump complicates matters, but you can compensate by laying your iPhone face-down and placing coins around the perimeter.
Alternatively, you can use [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+To+Use+Screen+Vise+Clamps/142291|screen vise clamps] around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive.
You can use coins of any denomination, so long as they are [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/knXTbG3jswp6xOxV|as thick or slightly thicker than the camera bump|new_window=true].
If your iPhone has a high-gloss finish, such as Jet Black, add a strip of tape around the perimeter to protect the finish before placing any coins.
Place a coin at each corner of your iPhone, and place two coins on either side of the camera bump.
Place additional coins around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,249
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_8,"Place a coin at each corner of your iPhone, and place two coins on either side of the camera bump.
Place additional coins around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Using a hair dryer or heat gun, evenly heat the side edges all the way around the iPhone until they are slightly too hot to touch. The heat will help the adhesive form a more complete bond.  Don't overheat the iPhone, or you may cause the battery to ignite or damage other heat-sensitive components, like the display.",iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement,107
iPhone_Display_Adhesive_Replacement_9,"## Step 23
While the iPhone is still hot, grab at least four or five of your heaviest hardcover books, and place them squarely on top of your iPhone.
The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable.
Leave the books in place for about thirty minutes.

 - iPhone 6s Plus Display Assembly Adhesive


## Step 1
Before disassembling your iPhone, discharge the battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 3.4 mm Pentalobe screws on either side of the Lightning port.",iPhone_6s_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement,294
iPhone_6s_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement_3,"## Step 2
Opening the display on the 6s Plus separates a thin strip of adhesive around the perimeter of the display. If you prefer to replace the adhesive, have a set of new adhesive strips ready before you continue. It's possible to complete the repair without replacing the adhesive, and you probably won't notice any difference in functionality.
Apply a suction cup to the lower left corner of the display assembly.
If your display is badly cracked, [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Taping+Over+The+Display/103487|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen.


## Step 3
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the front panel and rear case.
Pulling too hard may damage the display assembly. Apply just enough pressure to create a small gap between the display assembly and the rear case.",iPhone_6s_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement,241
iPhone_6s_Plus_Home_Button_Assembly_Replacement_4,"## Step 4
The safest place to pry from is the notch in the front panel above the headphone jack.
While still maintaining pressure on the suction cup, insert the flat tip of a spudger into the gap, directly above the headphone jack.


## Step 5
Twist the spudger to widen the gap between the front panel and the rear case.


## Step 6
While firmly pulling up on the suction cup, slide the edge of the spudger under the bottom left corner of the display.

Pull up on the small nub on the suction cup to remove it from the display.


## Step 11
Gently grasp the display assembly and lift it up to open the phone, using the clips at the top of the front panel as a hinge.
Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.
Don't open the display more than 90º—it is still connected to the top of the phone by the display, digitizer, and front camera cables which can tear easily.
Add a rubber band to keep the display securely in place while you work. This prevents undue strain on the display cables.
In a pinch, you can use an unopened canned beverage to support the display.

How_to_Use_a_Heat_Gun_to_Soften_Adhesive_0,"# How to Use a Heat Gun to Soften Adhesive
Follow these instructions to use a heat gun to soften adhesive. Using a hair dryer is similar, but its procedure varies slightly.

A heat gun is a handheld device that emits a stream of hot air, usually at temperatures between 100 °C and 550 °C (200-1000 °F), with some hotter models heating up to 760 °C (1400 °F).

Before beginning, refer to the specific repair guide for detailed instructions such as the adhesive location and any surrounding sensitive components. Check your heat gun's user manual for any specific operating or safety procedures.


###Tools Required:

 - Heat Gun


###Parts Required:

 - None


## Safety precautions
Before you begin, make sure you have a plan in the event of a fire.
Keep the heat gun unplugged when not in use.
Avoid using extension cords to power your heat gun. Since heat guns require a high current draw, cheaper extension cords may  pose an additional fire risk.
If you're heating adhesive near or underneath a battery, make sure you've completely discharged the battery before proceeding.


## Set down the device
Place the device on a clean, heat resistant surface or mat.
Keep flammable materials away from the work area.",How_to_Use_a_Heat_Gun_to_Soften_Adhesive,263
How_to_Use_a_Heat_Gun_to_Soften_Adhesive_1,"## Set down the device
Place the device on a clean, heat resistant surface or mat.
Keep flammable materials away from the work area.


## Turn on the heat gun
Turn on the heat gun.
While heat guns can reach temperatures up to 1000 °F and higher, softening adhesives for electronics only requires a maximum of 200 °F. This can easily be achieved with the heat gun's low to medium-low setting.
Always start with the heat gun's lowest flow speed and temperature settings to avoid overheating the device you're working on.
If your heat gun has fine control over the temperature, keep it in the mid-to-low range. Anything higher could deform plastic or damage internal components.
When not in use, set the heat gun on a stable surface. The nozzle will remain hot after use.",How_to_Use_a_Heat_Gun_to_Soften_Adhesive,175
How_to_Use_a_Heat_Gun_to_Soften_Adhesive_2,"## Soften the adhesive
Position the tip of the heat gun 2–3 inches above the device.
The exposure time may change depending on the adhesive, temperature, and the distance between the heat gun and the device.
Move the heat gun along the area where the adhesive is located.
Always keep the heat gun in motion, and never leave it over one spot for too long—doing so could damage the device.
If the adhesive that needs softening is small, still keep the heat gun in motion, moving it around in little circles.
Some adhesives require multiple heating and prying cycles in order to loosen. Be patient to get the job done correctly and not quickly.
Allow the heat gun to cool down before you store it.

Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_4,"## ZIF Connectors
[link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_insertion_force|Zero insertion force (ZIF) connectors|new_window=true] are often used to secure delicate ribbon cables of many sizes. A hinged locking flap runs across the top of the socket, and the cable is inserted on one of the long edges.
To disconnect the cable, use a spudger, opening tool, or a clean fingernail to flip up the locking flap—this is the unlocked position.
Use the widest tool possible to avoid damaging the delicate hinge pins.
Once the flap is in the unlocked position, use tweezers or your fingers to gently pull the cable out of its socket.
If the cable has a pull tab, use it to grip the cable. You may damage the cable by gripping it directly.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,183
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_5,"If the cable has a pull tab, use it to grip the cable. You may damage the cable by gripping it directly.
Some cables may have small [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/23JriT5JEeAnnoso.full|""arms""|new_window=true] or [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/lc23VqUExNUhL1tV.full|notches|new_window=true] that help secure them. If this is the case, you'll need to lift the cable to free it and then pull it out.
To reconnect, make sure the locking flap is flipped up and gently reinsert the cable. Then, flip the locking flap down to secure the cable. ***The cable should slide into the socket with little to no force.*** If you're having trouble, remove it, check that the flap is fully unlocked, and try again.
Some cables (like the one pictured) may have a line that marks the edge of the connection area. Make sure you insert the cable so the line is flush with the edge of the socket.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,260
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_6,"## No-Fuss Ribbon Cable Connectors
You may run into a ribbon cable with a socket that looks like a [guide|25629|ZIF connector|stepid=64969|new_window=true] with ''no flap''. Usually, the cable will be more rigid and have a stiff, reinforced plastic end. These connectors are often found in larger devices such as printers, projectors, or games consoles.
Before trying to disconnect these cables, carefully check for a release mechanism and make sure it's not a ZIF connector. Otherwise, you may permanently damage the socket and cable by forcibly removing it.
Simply pull these ""no-fuss"" ribbon cables straight out of their socket to disconnect them.
To reconnect the cable, hold it as close to the end as possible and insert it back into the connector. Apply force to the plastic reinforcement rather than the cable itself.
Try not to kink or crease the cable.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,204
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_7,"## Locking Tab Connectors
Some ribbon cable connectors have a plastic locking tab around them. These are often used in large game consoles and mice.
Use a spudger to gently push up on alternating sides of the plastic tab until it clicks up into its unlocked position.
Don't push the tab too hard or too far, otherwise it may come completely off the connector.
Once the tab is unlocked, you can gently pull the cable straight out of its socket.
The cable should be able to slide in and out of the socket with little to no force. If you feel resistance, the tab may not be fully unlocked.
During reassembly, insert the cable into its socket and use the flat end of a spudger to [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/cZaDQHqKPKnXMXNw.full|push the tab down|new_window=true] into its locked position.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,206

There are many other types of ribbon cable connectors that might require you to mix-and-match disconnection methods. Some [[Topic:Microsoft TV Console|Xbox gaming consoles|new_window=true]] have ribbons cables with a section that loops around the connector, ''and'' have a locking tab.
To disconnect this connector, use a spudger or clean fingernail to lift the looped tab away from the connector.
Then, use the tip of the spudger to push the plastic locking tab away from the socket—it should only move about 1–2 mm.
You can now pull the cable straight out of its socket.
To reinstall:
Fully insert the cable into its socket under the locking tab.
Loop the tab around the front of the connector.
Use a spudger or clean fingernail to push in the locking tab, securing the cable.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,193
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_9,"## Flat-Topped (Low Profile) Connectors
Some connectors have a flat, plastic top that sits flush on top of their socket. Often, these connectors have multiple cables connected to them. Flat-topped connectors are usually on the larger side, and are typically used to connect batteries in laptops and larger gaming devices.
To disconnect the cable, use the flat end of a spudger to lift and unclip the outer edges of the connector. You may need to use your fingers to pull the connector completely out of its socket.
Sometimes, these connectors have a slide lock running across the top that holds the connector in place. If this is the case, [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/jQW5Ksl6jsM5MwFV.full|push the lock away from the connector|new_window=true] before trying to disconnect it.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,204

To reconnect the cable, carefully position the connector over its socket and press straight down—the connector should snap into place without much force. If you're having trouble, the connector is most likely misaligned. Reposition it and try again.
Don't try to force the connector into place or you may damage the delicate pins.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,156
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_11,"## Press Connectors
Press (or ""pop"") connectors are found at the end of a ribbon cable and have a flat, metal or plastic top—typically rectangular. These connectors are extremely common in smartphones and laptops, and connect a wide variety of small to medium-sized cables—screen, battery, board interconnect, etc.
Place a spudger or an opening tool under the connector's edge and pry straight up to disconnect it.
Make sure to pry under the edge of the connector itself, and not under the socket on the board. Otherwise, you risk permanently damaging the socket.
Work carefully: don't pry on or accidentally scrape any small, [link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology|surface mounted components|new_window=true] on the board.
Although more rare, some larger pop-style connectors might have a built-in pull-tab for easy disconnection. Lift straight up to disconnect these.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,216
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_12,"Although more rare, some larger pop-style connectors might have a built-in pull-tab for easy disconnection. Lift straight up to disconnect these.
To reconnect, align the connector carefully over its socket and press down with your fingertip—first on one of the ''short'' sides, then the other—until it clicks into place. Don't try to force the connector into place. If you're having trouble, reposition it and try again.
***Don't press down on the middle of wider connectors*** until they're fully seated. If misaligned, the connector or the pins underneath can bend or break, causing permanent damage.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,149
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_13,"## Coaxial Connectors
Coaxial connectors like these—also called antenna, U.FL, or IPEX connectors—have a metal head that snaps over a circular socket on the board, like a metal snap button on a shirt. These connectors come in various sizes and are often used to connect Wi-Fi or cellular antenna cables.
To disconnect the cable, slide a thin, ESD-safe pry tool or [product|IF145-020-5|angled tweezers|new_window=true] under the metal neck of the connector (as close to the head as possible) and ***lift straight up*** from the board.
If you work with these connectors often, you may want to buy a specialized disconnect tool ([product|IF145-558|small size|new_window=true], [product|IF145-557|large size|new_window=true]). These tools speed up the disconnect and reconnect procedures while minimizing the risk of damage.
When working with these connectors, it's key to always lift the head straight up. If pried on at an odd angle, you risk breaking the socket off of the board underneath.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,269
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_14,"When working with these connectors, it's key to always lift the head straight up. If pried on at an odd angle, you risk breaking the socket off of the board underneath.
Reconnecting these can be tricky.  Use tweezers to hold the connector in place over its socket and gently press down with your finger or a spudger—the connector should ""snap"" into place. If you're having trouble, reposition the head and try again.
Don't try to force the connector into place or you may permanently damage it.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,116
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_15,"## Display Cable Connectors
Display (sometimes called eDP cables in laptops) and camera cable connectors often have a small metal buckle running around the socket, locking them in place. The connectors are typically wide and may have tape attached to the buckle.
Disconnecting these cables is a two-step process. First, gently push the tip of a spudger under the metal buckle to unclip it, then swing it over the socket.
Next, hold the buckle and cable ''together'' and gently pull the connector straight out of its socket.
To reconnect:
Grip the cable and buckle together and insert the connector fully into its socket.
Aligning the connector can be tricky. Reposition it as necessary and don't try to force it into the socket, or you may damage both the connector and its socket.
Flip the buckle over the socket and use a spudger to press the buckle down until it clicks into place.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,197
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_16,"## Sliding Connectors
Some connectors slide into the side or top of their sockets and have no convenient place to pry or pull. Typically, these connectors have multiple cables attached and are used for small batteries or speakers.
To disconnect, use the point of a spudger to push on alternating sides of the connector to ""walk"" it out of its socket.
It may take a lot of alternating before the connector comes out. Be patient, and ***don't pull on the cables***.
To reconnect the cable, align the connector and use a spudger or clean fingernail to push it fully into the socket.
Don't push on the cables themselves, or you may damage the connector.
Some connectors (like the one pictured) have a [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/vxic2PfJnEIjXNSM.full|small marking|new_window=true] that shows which side of the connector should be facing up.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,222
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_17,"## Large Sliding Connectors
Large sliding connectors work the same as smaller sliding connectors, usually sliding into the side of a socket. Typically, these connectors have multiple cables attached and are commonly used for laptop batteries.
Most of the time, these connectors will have a lip or a tab along the top that can be used to push the connector out of its socket.
If there's no clear spot to use a tool, check out [guide|25629|bundled cable connectors|stepid=64977|new_window=true].
To disconnect, use the wide end of a spudger to push on the connector tab to slide it out of its socket.
It may take a lot of force to disconnect the cable. Go slowly, and ***don't pull on the cables***.
To reconnect the cable, align the connector and use a spudger to [guide|168674|push against the tab|stepid=356120|new_window=true] to fully seat the connector back into the socket.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,231
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_18,"## JST Connectors
[link|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector|JST connectors|new_window=true] are a type of sliding connector that usually have multiple twisted cables attached to it. They're typically on the smaller side and are often used in mice or for speakers.
To disconnect the cable, first try pushing on alternating sides of the connector, like [guide|25629|small sliding connectors|stepid=64975|new_window=true].
If that doesn't work, use a pair of tweezers to firmly grip the sides of the connector and pull straight away from the socket. Hold the tweezers closer to the connector to get a better grip.
If you're having trouble, try rocking the connector side-to-side to loosen it.
If the connector's socket has [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/NsIsepcc2mNXwW4l.full|cutouts|new_window=true], you can insert the arms of a pair of sharp tweezers into the cutouts and gently push the connector out of its socket.
To reconnect the cable, insert the connector into its socket and push on the edges until it's fully seated.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,288
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_19,"## Power Cable Connectors
Power or power supply cable connectors usually have multiple cables running to a large plug with a locking tab. They're often found in larger electronic devices, like gaming consoles and desktop PCs.
Squeeze the tab against the connector and pull straight up to disconnect it.
To reconnect, push the connector over the socket until the clip engages. You'll hear and feel a distinct ""click.""


## Bundled Cable Connectors
Bundled cable connectors have many small wires leading into them, often wrapped in a sleeve. They may not have anywhere to push with a spudger or a spot to grip with tweezers. Pulling on the cables themselves might be the only option.
This should be a last resort if the [guide|25629|sliding connector|stepid=64975|new_window=true] and [guide|25629|JST connector|stepid=370865|new_window=true] disconnection methods didn't work.
Grip all the cables at once ''as close to the connector as possible'' and pull the connector slowly and steadily out of its socket.
Pull evenly on the full width of the cables so no individual wires are strained.
To reconnect, align the connector and use a spudger or clean fingernail to push the connector head fully into the socket.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,283
Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_20,"## Glued-Down Cables
Sometimes removing the connector from its socket isn’t enough—an additional step or two is required to free up the cable. Here we have a ribbon cable that is lightly glued into place.
To remove it, carefully slide a spudger or opening pick under the cable to separate its adhesive.
For particularly delicate or stubborn cables, a little heat from a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or our handy [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] will help soften the adhesive.


## SATA Cables
Some common internal power and data cables, like these SATA cables, work much like the regular audio/video cables you already have around the house.
To remove them, pull in the direction of the cable.
Some variants of the SATA cable have a small metal release tab on the side that you may need to press before pulling.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,215

The next three steps show how to separate the screen using a suction cup.
Heating the lower edge of the iPhone will help soften the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open.
Use a hairdryer or [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iOpener+Heating/25705|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] and apply it to the lower edge of the phone for about 90 seconds in order to soften up the adhesive underneath.


## Separate the display
Apply a suction cup to the lower half of the front panel, just above the home button.
Be sure the suction cup does not overlap with the home button, as this will prevent a seal from forming between the suction cup and front glass.


## Step 6
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the screen and the frame.
Insert an opening pick into the gap.
The watertight adhesive holding the screen in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force.

Remove the Taptic Engine.
Be careful removing Taptic Engine flex cable as it may be glued to the antenna flex cable.


## Remove the battery adhesive
The iPhone's battery is secured by four pieces of stretch-release adhesive—two at the top, and two at the bottom.
Each piece of adhesive has a black pull-tab at the end, which is lightly adhered to the front surface of the battery.


## Step 2
Peel back the first battery adhesive tab from the bottom right edge of the battery.
If possible, use your fingernails or [product|IF145-020-4|blunt tweezers]. Be careful not to poke the battery with any sharp tools.",iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement,152
iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement_14,"## Step 3
Try to keep the adhesive strips flat and unwrinkled during this procedure; twisted or wrinkled strips will stick together and break instead of pulling out cleanly.
Additionally, do not press down on the battery as you pull the strips. Pressing on the battery creates pressure points that can snag and break the adhesive.
'''''Slowly''''' pull one battery adhesive tab away from the battery, towards the bottom of the iPhone.
Pull steadily, maintaining constant tension on the strip until it slips out from between the battery and the rear case. For best results, '''pull the strip at as low an angle as possible''', without snagging it on any of the iPhone's other components.
The strip will stretch to many times its original length. Continue pulling and re-grab the strip near the battery if necessary.
If the battery adhesive tabs break during the removal process, use your fingers or blunt tweezers to retrieve the remaining length of adhesive, and continue pulling.
If any of the adhesive strips break underneath the battery and cannot be retrieved, try to remove the remaining strips, and then proceed as instructed below.",iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement,248
iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement_15,"## Step 4
Repeat the above steps to remove the remaining three adhesive strips.
Be sure to hold onto the battery as you remove the final strip, or it may fling out of the iPhone unexpectedly.
If you removed all of the adhesive strips successfully, skip the next step.

iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement_16,"## Step 5
If any of the adhesive strips broke off and the battery remains stuck to the rear case, remove it by adding a few drops of isopropyl alcohol (90% or greater) underneath the battery near the stuck strip(s). After about a minute, gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.
If you choose to use pry tools to lift the battery out of the iPhone, use extreme caution or you may damage the ribbon cables or the wireless charging coil directly underneath the battery.
If the battery remains stuck to the rear case, [guide|11677|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] or use a hair dryer to heat the rear case directly behind the battery. This will help soften the adhesive.
Heat the iPhone until the rear case is slightly too hot to comfortably touch. Don't overheat the iPhone, or you may accidentally ignite the battery.
Alternatively, thread a strong piece of string (such as dental floss or a length of thin guitar string) underneath the battery.",iPhone_SE_2020_Battery_Replacement,256

How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_2,"## Identify the adhesive strips
Look over your pre-cut adhesive strips and figure out what they are used for.
Here are some common adhesives used in a phone repair, and examples of what they may look like:
Screen or back cover adhesives—usually the shape of the device
Back cover support adhesives—these will match the contours of components pressed against the back cover
Battery adhesives—normally a rectangular perimeter roughly the shape of the phone's battery
Component adhesives—they will be contoured to match the various components such as cameras and fingerprint sensors they are designed for
You usually want to apply the screen or back cover adhesives last. Be sure to apply all component adhesives beforehand, and if possible, test your repair before sealing up the device.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,168
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_3,"## Prepare the surface
To ensure a good adhesive bond, both your device and part need to be thoroughly cleaned. This may take some time, but the results are worth the effort.
Remove large chunks of adhesives with your fingers, spudger, plastic opening tool, or [product|IF145-020|tweezers].
Don't use metal tools if you're cleaning display panels or glass covers, as the tools may scratch the surface.
Use adhesive remover or isopropyl alcohol (>70%) to remove residue from metal surfaces. Wipe in one direction with a lint-free cloth or coffee filter until all the adhesive residue is gone.
While isopropyl alcohol is generally safe to use on electronics, they will dissolve certain foam adhesives. Be careful to contain the alcohol when cleaning.
Allow the alcohol to completely evaporate from the device before reassembly.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,195
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_4,"## Orient the adhesives
Custom-cut adhesive strips are shaped such that they install onto a device in only one way. When orienting your adhesive, look for distinct cutouts or markings that hint at how to place the adhesive:
Cutouts for components or liner pull-tabs in the frame
Alignment markings outlining the desired position
Holes for spring contacts or cameras
Most adhesive strips will have a neutral/clear liner covering one side and a colored liner covering the other. ***You'll be peeling the neutral/clear liner first and applying the exposed adhesive to its corresponding surface.***
For example, if your back cover adhesive's clear liner faces the phone frame, you'll stick the adhesive strip to the frame first. If the clear liner faces the back cover, you'll stick the strip to the cover first.
If the adhesive comes in pieces, match each piece to the device by its contours and [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/MgYqqOlXMUrnWWnj.full|set them next to your device|new_window=true].",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,251
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_5,"To ease the process of removing liners without losing alignment, you can align the strip to its intended position on the device, [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/rHTnwLMOILG4hXIr.full|then tape one edge down to hold the strip in place.|new_window=true]",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,83
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_6,"## Remove the adhesive liner
Once you have a good idea how the adhesive strip fits on the surface, peel the neutral/clear liner off.
If you're applying a back cover or screen adhesive and it comes with extra material in the center, you may need to remove it before applying the adhesive.
Carefully peel away the center portion of both the liner and adhesive layers, [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/MooIq3wXf33HLMWs.huge|starting with the cutout (if present)|new_window=true].
Peel off and discard the remaining neutral/clear liner, exposing the adhesive underneath.


## Apply the adhesive
Be very careful as you align the adhesive! The adhesive is very sticky and deforms easily. Once it touches a surface, you can't reposition it—you'll likely need to start over with a new strip.
As you position the adhesive, look for alignment holes that line up with physical holes in the frame of your device.
Some adhesives feature unique cutouts in the corners that reflect holes or features in the frame.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,254
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_7,"## Step 6
Hold the exposed strip by its tabs and carefully line up a long edge of the adhesive to the edge of the device.
Set the adhesive onto the surface and press it firmly onto the surface with your fingers.
Peel away the colored liner from the adhesive strip to expose the remaining adhesive side.


## Step 7
Hold the part to your device firmly for 20–30 seconds.


## Further strengthen the adhesive bond
Once you've installed your part or sealed up your device, you can strengthen the bond by heating up the adhesive.
Soft adhesives, which are usually messy and hard to clean, benefit from a reheat.
Harder adhesives that resemble tape may not benefit as much, but the heat can help the adhesive fill in gaps.
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true], or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] to lightly heat the part or closed device in the areas where the new adhesive was applied.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,238
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_8,"## Step 9
Follow the remaining steps if you're securing a new screen or back cover.
If your device has an uneven surface (often a camera bump), ***skip to the next step***.
Lay your device on a flat surface and stack heavy objects on it. Multiple large books work well.
Keep the objects stacked on your device for at least a few hours to allow the adhesive to settle and bond. Ideally, leave them in place overnight.


## Accommodate uneven back covers
Most modern phones and tablets have prominent protrusions around the cameras. If you're securing a new screen or back cover, you must account for these uneven surfaces.
The remaining steps show three ways to apply even pressure across the entire device.


## Step 11
If your device came in a box that has cutouts for the protrusions in the back cover, use it to allow the device to sit flat.
Place your device in the box so it sits with even pressure all around the back cover.
Stack heavy objects on the device and leave them in place for at least a few hours to allow the adhesive to settle. Ideally, leave them in place overnight.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,240
How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips_9,"## Step 12
Alternatively, you can stack small objects around the back to level out the height of the cameras.
Lay strips of tape around the perimeter of your device to protect it from scratches.
Stack coins or similar objects around the perimeter so they're roughly equal to the height of the protrusions in the back cover.
Place heavy objects, such as multiple books, on top of the coins and leave them for a few hours. Don't use any valuable books, as the coins might leave an impression.


## Use screen vise clamps
Lastly, [product|IF145-488|screen vise clamps|new_window=true] are a great way to secure screens and back covers. [guide|142291|Follow this guide|new_window=true] to use them on your device.
If properly applied, the adhesive should work reliably for a long time.

The repair may not restore the device’s water resistance. Be careful not to expose the device to liquids.",How_to_Apply_Custom-cut_Adhesive_Strips,212

iPhone_7_Plus_Screen_Replacement_1,"## Step 1
Before you begin, discharge your iPhone battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 3.4 mm pentalobe screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Opening the iPhone's display will compromise its waterproof seals. Have [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-7-Plus-Display-Assembly-Adhesive/IF333-011-1|replacement seals|new_window=true] ready before you proceed past this step, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iPhone without replacing the seals.


## Mark your opening picks
If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage.
Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker.
You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements.

Slide the display assembly slightly down (away from the top edge of the phone) to disengage the clips holding it to the rear case.


## Step 13
Open the iPhone by swinging the display up from the left side, like the back cover of a book.
Don't try to fully separate the display yet, as several fragile ribbon cables still connect it to the iPhone's logic board.
Lean the display against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.


## Step 1
Remove the following four tri-point Y000 screws securing the lower display cable bracket to the logic board:
Three 1.2 mm screws
One 2.6 mm screw


## Step 2

Use the point of a spudger to lift the battery connector out of its socket on the logic board.
Bend the connector cable up slightly to prevent it from making contact with the socket and providing power to  the phone.


## Step 1
Make sure the battery is disconnected before you disconnect or reconnect the cables in this step.
Use the flat end of a spudger or a fingernail to disconnect the two lower display connectors by prying them straight up from their sockets on the logic board.
To re-attach press connectors, press down on one end until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other end. Do not press down on the middle. If the connector is even slightly misaligned, the connector can bend, causing permanent damage.
If you have a blank screen, white lines on the display, or partial or complete lack of touch response after reassembling your phone, try disconnecting and carefully reconnecting both of these cables and make sure they are fully seated.

The iPhone 7 Plus home “button” is actually a solid-state sensor, which also includes Touch ID (fingerprint recognition) capability.

'''Most replacement home buttons won’t work''', so check carefully before starting your repair. Your iPhone’s original home button is uniquely paired to the logic board at the factory—and without Apple’s proprietary calibration process, even a genuine replacement home button from another iPhone won’t work. To fix a broken home button, you should install a specially-made, [product|IF332-079|universal-style home button]. Note that these replacements only work as a button; Touch ID will not function.

If you are only replacing a broken screen, you can use this guide to carefully remove and transfer your working original home button to a new screen, preserving all functions, including Touch ID.

During this procedure, to avoid accidentally straining or tearing the display cables, it's best to completely detach the display assembly before beginning repairs on the home/Touch ID sensor. But if you are comfortable doing so, you may skip the display assembly section of this guide and go straight to the home/Touch ID sensor section.

The iPhone 8 Plus home “button” is actually a solid-state sensor, which also includes Touch ID (fingerprint recognition) capability.

'''Most replacement home buttons won’t work''', so check carefully before starting your repair. Your iPhone’s original home button is uniquely paired to the logic board at the factory—and without Apple’s proprietary calibration process, even a genuine replacement home button from another iPhone won’t work. To fix a broken home button, you should install a specially-made, [product|IF332-079|universal-style home button]. Note that these replacements only work as a button; Touch ID will not function.

If you are only replacing a broken screen, you can use this guide to carefully remove and transfer your working original home button to a new screen, preserving all functions, including Touch ID.

During this procedure, to avoid accidentally straining or tearing the display cables, it's best to completely detach the display assembly before beginning repairs on the home/Touch ID sensor. But if you are comfortable doing so, you may skip the display assembly section of this guide and go straight to the home/Touch ID sensor section.

"iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_3","## Step 1
Before you begin, it's a good idea to test-fit your new battery in the iPhone.
This works best after reinstalling the speaker and Taptic Engine. Refer to the guide you used to remove your old battery.
Make sure the battery connector lines up correctly with its socket on the logic board.
Be careful not to touch the Face ID camera and sensor hardware along the top edge of the iPhone (the ""notch"" area).


## Step 2
If your test-fit looks good, take the battery back out and place it face-down on your work surface (with the connector contacts facing up).
If your battery came with new adhesive strips already installed, '''[https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+X+XS+and+XS+Max+Battery+Adhesive+Strips+Replacement/117505#s228264|skip to Step 7]'''.
If you have a two-cell battery, make sure the cells are aligned as they would be when installed in the iPhone.","iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement",229
"iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_4","## Step 3
Peel off the '''blue''' plastic liner from your new set of adhesive strips, and discard it.
Some strips have a single large blue liner, while others have a two-piece liner. Either way, peel it all off.
Once the adhesive is exposed, be careful not to touch it.


## Step 4
Once the adhesive sticks to the battery, you can't peel it off or reposition it—if you make a mistake, you'll have to start over with fresh adhesive strips.
Double-check the orientation of the adhesive strips, and make sure your battery is still lying face-down (with the connector contacts facing up).
Carefully position the adhesive strips over the battery, and stick them in place as shown.
Place the strips slightly off-center, very close to the long edge of the battery.
The black pull tabs at each end should protrude equally far over the top and bottom edges of the battery.


## Step 5
Use your fingers or a cloth to press the strips firmly into place on the battery.
Press in the center to adhere the black regulatory label to the battery as well.","iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement",244
"iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_5","## Step 5
Use your fingers or a cloth to press the strips firmly into place on the battery.
Press in the center to adhere the black regulatory label to the battery as well.


## Step 6
Roll your fingertip along the edges of the battery to stick down the black pull tab at the end of each adhesive strip.
Be sure to get all four tabs—three on the bottom edge, and one on the top.


## Step 7
Peel off and discard the pink liner, fully exposing the adhesive strips.


## Step 8
When installing the battery, be careful not to touch the Face ID camera and sensor hardware along the top edge of the iPhone (the ""notch"" area).
Carefully position the battery and set it into the iPhone.
Make sure the battery connector lines up with its socket on the logic board.
It's okay to temporarily connect the battery to make sure it lines up correctly, but make certain it's disconnected before reassembling your iPhone.","iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement",203
"iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_6","## Step 9
Press the battery firmly onto the adhesive strips to secure it in place.
If your battery came with an additional plastic liner on the top, peel it off and discard it before closing up your phone.
To reassemble your iPhone, return to the guide you used to remove the battery and follow the remaining steps in reverse order.

A thin rubber gasket around the SIM tray provides water and dust protection. If this gasket is damaged or missing, replace the gasket or the entire SIM tray to protect your iPhone's internal components.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,138
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_2,"## Step 1
Before you begin, discharge your iPhone battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 6.9 mm-long pentalobe screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.
If the screws are stripped or damaged, [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-X-Bottom-Screws/IF377-047-2|replace the screws|new_window=true].
Opening the iPhone's display will compromise its waterproof seals. Have [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone-X-Display-Assembly-Adhesive/IF377-048-1|replacement seals|new_window=true] ready before you proceed past this step, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iPhone without replacing the seals.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,214
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_3,"## Mark your opening picks
If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage.
Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker.
You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements.
Alternatively, [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/pQGATIGUbViSB4gB.full|tape a coin to a pick|new_window=true] 3 mm from the tip.


## Tape over any cracks
If your iPhone has a cracked screen, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping over the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's screen until the whole face is covered.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.
If you can't get the suction cup to stick in the next few steps, fold a strong piece of tape (such as duct tape) into a handle and lift the screen with that instead.
If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the screen.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,246
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_4,"## Anti-Clamp instructions
The next three steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method.***
For complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].
Pull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.
Slide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.
Position the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone—one on the front, and one on the back.
Squeeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.
If you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use tape|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.


## Step 3
Pull the blue handle forward to lock the arms.
Turn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch.
Make sure the suction cups remain aligned with each other. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,277
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_5,"## Step 4
[link|https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iOpener+Heating/25705|new_window=true|Heat an iOpener] and thread it through the arms of the Anti-Clamp.
You can also use a [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Use+a+Hair+Dryer+to+Soften+Adhesive/157348|new_window=true|hair dryer], [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/How+to+Use+a+Heat+Gun+to+Soften+Adhesive/151116|new_window=true|heat gun], or hot plate—but extreme heat can damage the display and/or internal battery, so proceed with care.
Fold the iOpener so it lays on the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Wait one minute to give the adhesive a chance to release and present an opening gap.
Insert an opening pick under the screen and the plastic bezel, ***not the screen itself.***
If the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, apply more heat to the area and rotate the handle a quarter turn.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,275
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_7,"## Step 5
Heating the lower edge of the iPhone will help soften the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open.
Use a [guide|157348|hairdryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] or [guide|25705|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] and apply it to the lower edge of the iPhone for about a minute in order to soften up the adhesive underneath.
If you use a hairdryer or heat gun, do not heat to much because that can result in damaging the screen.


## Step 6
If using a single suction handle, apply it to the bottom edge of the phone, while avoiding the curved portion of the glass.


## Step 7
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the screen and the frame.
Insert an opening pick into the gap under the screen's plastic bezel, ***not the screen itself.***
The watertight adhesive holding the screen in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force. If you're having a hard time opening a gap, apply more heat, and gently rock the screen up and down to weaken the adhesive until you create enough of a gap to insert your tool.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,288
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_8,"## Step 8
Slide the opening pick around the lower left corner and up the left edge of the iPhone, slicing through the adhesive holding the display in place.
Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage internal components.


## Screen information
There are delicate cables along the right edge of your iPhone. ***Don't insert your pick here***, as you may damage the cables.


## Step 10
Re-insert your pick at the bottom edge of the iPhone, and slide it up the right side to continue separating the adhesive.
Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage the display cables.


## Step 11
The top edge of the display is secured with both glue and clips.
Slide the opening pick around the top corner of the display, while gently pulling or wiggling the display '''''down''''' in the direction of the Lightning port.
The clips will break if you use too much force. Work carefully and be patient.
Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage the front panel sensor array.

Repeat the above step to separate the remaining two adhesive tabs from the bottom edge of the battery.
Take care not to damage the speaker cable connector just below the center adhesive tab.


## Step 4
In the following steps, you'll pull each tab to slowly stretch out the adhesive underneath the battery. This special stretch-release adhesive loses its tack when stretched and then comes out in your hand, allowing you to lift out the battery with ease.
If the strips break, don't panic! They don't always work as intended. Keep reading for some additional steps for removing broken strips.
To increase your odds of success:
Don't press down on the battery. Hold the iPhone firmly by its sides.
Keep the strips flat and unwrinkled as you pull.
Pull ''very slowly'', giving the strip time to stretch and separate. It takes around 15-30 seconds of stretching to remove each strip.
Pull at a low angle so the strip doesn't snag along the bottom edge of the battery.
If a strip does break off underneath the battery and cannot be retrieved, move on to the other strips and then continue with the additional steps below.",iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement,249
iPhone_X_Power_and_Audio_Exterior_Buttons_Replacement_18,"## Step 5
Grab one of the outer battery adhesive tabs and slowly pull it away from the battery, toward the bottom of the iPhone.
Pull steadily, maintaining constant tension on the strip until it slips out from between the battery and the rear case.
The strip will stretch to many times its original length. Continue pulling and re-grab the strip near the battery if necessary.
If the battery adhesive tabs break during the removal process, use your fingers or [product|IF145-020-4|blunt tweezers] to retrieve the remaining length of adhesive, and continue pulling.
If any of the adhesive strips break underneath the battery and cannot be retrieved, try to remove the remaining strips, and then proceed as instructed below.


## Step 6
Repeat the previous step to remove the strip on the opposite side, leaving the center strip for last.


## Step 7
Remove the center strip, being careful not to snag it on the speaker flex cable.


## Step 8

Replacing of iPhone X display assembly usually won’t affect Face ID. However, we get complaints from our clients that Face ID on the phone failed after replacing of the display assembly. We have done some researches and our guess is that the problem might be caused by improper operation during the replacing process, which results in damage of flex cables or other components.

## Malfunction
The iPhone X shows an alert that says it is ‘unable to activate Face ID on this iPhone’.
When trying to setup Face ID on the iPhone X, we get the message 'Face ID is Not Available, try setting up Face ID later'.
Also, according to the feedback from our client, Face ID on the phone is available after being dropped. However, Face ID is not available after replacing of the display assembly.
Unavailable Face ID might be caused by improper operation when replacing the display assembly.

Remove the ambient light sensor module flex cable afterwards.


## Troubleshoot
Turn the flex cable upside-down and secure it again. Remove the Flood illuminator module.
Prepare a new flex cable. Apply some Paste Flux to the bonding pad and solder the detached Flood illuminator module.


## Troubleshoot
Solder the detached ambient light sensor module flex cable.
Now we need to solder the earpiece speaker back to flex cable and get it installed to the display assembly. Secure with screws afterwards.


## Test

Apple has paired a couple of assemblies to the logic board, presumably for security purposes to ensure that Face ID can't be hacked. Therefore it is impossible for the do-it-yourself repairer to replace any of those three parts and still have Face ID work.

The only thing an average person can do outside of taking the phone to Apple for repair is to replace all three parts together with ones salvaged from an original phone. Here's what's needed:

- Logic Board

- Front Facing Camera Assembly (Paired to that logic board)

- Proximity Sensor / Earphone Assembly (Paired to that logic board)

That being said, there are other repairs that can be made if Face ID stops working, but they generally require skill in microsoldering; not something just anyone can do. For example, the flex cable that connects the front camera to the logic board can get damaged and it is possible to replace it; it's just that it's very difficult without precise equipment and a particular set of skills.

This guide will step you through replacing the three paired components from a damaged phone into a new phone.

###Tools Required:

 - None


###Parts Required:

 - None


## Step 1
Apple has encrypted the battery of iPhone XS and models above. Once you replace the battery, you will get the “Important Battery Message” and “Service” message. To make matters worse, the cycle count of the new battery will show the cycle count of the original battery.
Especially the battery data of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series still can’t be accessed. It has been verified by technicians that the “Important Battery Message” will show up after you put in an aftermarket battery or a genuine Apple battery.
You can only avoid the problem by letting Apple Stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers replace your battery.


## Step 2
To solve the problem, the latest solution has been verified. Today we will share solutions concerning iPhone XS series, iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series.
First of all, we will introduce the structure of the battery. The battery can be roughly divided into two parts – BMS board and battery cell. The battery management system board mainly serves as a protection board but also saves battery data. The battery cell is where the power is stored.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,285
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_1,"## Step 3
Taking iPhone XS for example, we need to prepare a battery data corrector and a new battery cell that can be an original one or an aftermarket one. Disassemble the phone and remove the battery.
Then we need to Spot Weld the BMS board of the original battery to the new battery cell. Remove the protective tape on the BMS board. Please do not break the flex cable.
Disconnect the cathode and anode of the battery with a pair of scissors.


## Step 4
Remove the original battery BMS board. Please align the anode and cathode respectively.
Solder with the Spot Welder.
After soldering, install the BMS board. Apply the protection tape.


## Step 5
Since the BMS board is replaced and the battery is protected, the voltage can’t be measured. We need to activate the battery with a Direct Current Supply.
Connect the battery to the programmer. Click reading. Battery data on the BMS board can be seen.


## Step 6
Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Then we connect the display to the motherboard. Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,254
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_2,"## Step 6
Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Then we connect the display to the motherboard. Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.


## Step 7
Please be noted that you can only turn on the phone by a power cable. The above step takes advantage of bugs in iOS and is a very important step. Then we install the new battery. Go to “Settings” to view the battery health information. The maximum capacity is 100% and there is no “Important Battery Message”.
Different from iPhone XS series, the battery data of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series is encrypted and cannot be accessed. That is to say, even if you replace with the original battery cell, the battery data still can’t be read. Worse still, you can’t correct the battery health and cycle count.
Recently, we have got the latest battery data corrector on the market. Through verification, the corrector can effectively remove the “Important Battery Message” of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series. Next, we will share the operation process in detail by an iPhone 11 Pro.
Remove the BMS board of the original battery. Solder the BMS board to the new battery cell.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,260
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_3,"## Step 8
Install the BMS board. Activate the battery with a Direct Current Supply.
Because the data of iPhone 11 series can’t be directly read, we need a specialized PCB board to read the data. Install the PCB board to the battery.


## Step 9
Then connect the battery to the programmer. Click reading. Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.
Then we install the new battery. Go to “Settings” to view the battery health information. The maximum capacity is 100% and there is no “Important Battery Message”.

If the adhesive breaks off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, apply a few drops of high concentration (over 90%) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery in the area of the broken adhesive strip(s).
Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive. Use the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.
Be careful not to damage the ribbon cables or the wireless charging coil directly underneath the battery.
For an alternative method to unstick the battery, '''continue with the next step below'''.",iPhone_XR_Battery_Replacement,223

If any of the adhesive strips broke off and the battery remains stuck to the rear case, [guide|11677|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] or use a hair dryer to heat the rear case directly behind the battery. This will help soften the adhesive.
Heat the iPhone until the rear case is slightly too hot to comfortably touch. Don't overheat the iPhone, or you may accidentally ignite the battery.
Flip the iPhone back over and thread a strong piece of string (such as dental floss or a length of thin guitar string) underneath the battery.
Wrap the ends of the string around a cloth (or wear gloves) to protect your fingers.
Pull the string from side to side in a sawing motion all along the length of the battery to separate the adhesive. This can take some time since the adhesive is slow to deform, but with patience it will come free. '''Do not deform or damage the battery.'''

Each piece of adhesive has a black pull-tab at one end, which is lightly adhered and folded onto the top of the battery.


## Peel back the lower pull tabs
Peel back the three battery adhesive pull tabs from the bottom edge of the battery.
Be careful not to jab the battery with any sharp tools—a punctured battery may leak dangerous chemicals or catch fire.",iPhone_11_Battery_Replacement,132

To increase your odds of success:
Don't press down on the battery. Hold the iPhone firmly by its sides.
Keep the strips flat and unwrinkled as you pull.
Pull very slowly, giving the strip time to stretch and separate. It takes around 30 seconds of stretching to remove each strip.
Pull at a '''low angle''' so the strip doesn't snag along the bottom edge of the battery.
If a strip does break off underneath the battery and cannot be retrieved, move on to the other strips and then continue with the additional steps below.",iPhone_11_Battery_Replacement,180

Heat the iPhone until the rear case is slightly too hot to comfortably touch, but no more.
Flip the iPhone back over and thread a strong piece of string (such as dental floss) underneath the battery.
Wear gloves to protect your fingers, or wrap each end of the string around a tool.
Pull the string from side to side in a sawing motion to separate the adhesive.   This can take some time since the adhesive is slow to deform, but with patience it will come free. ***Do not deform or damage the battery.***
Start from the top or bottom edge of the battery, and pull toward the middle. Don't pull the string through the middle third of the battery, or you may damage the ribbon cables or the wireless charging coil directly underneath.

## Why the Display Repair Warning for iPhone 11 series appears?
Why the Display Repair Warning for iPhone 11 series appears? The system will verify the touch module data during start up. Since the touch module is located on the back of the screen, screen replacement can result in a mismatch between the touch module data and the phone.
The only workable solution by now is to solder the touch module of the original screen onto the new replacement screen.
Also, since the touch module is located on the back of the screen, traditional desoldering tools can easily damage the screen. We will adopt a new chip grinding tool today.",iPhone_11_Series_Non-Genuine_Screen_Warning/Important_Display_Message_-_100%_Fix,226

Stick high-temperature tape around the touch module on the replacement screen.  Then wrap the screen with protective film.
Now we will grind the touch module with the electric chip grinding tool.
Be patient during the grinding. Start with the top layer then move on to the next layer. Also, be careful not to damage flex cables nearby.
With solder joints coming out, stop the grinding work. Clean the bonding pad with PCB Cleaner soaked cotton swap afterwards.


## Chip Removing

## Step 6
If you're using a single suction handle, apply it to the bottom edge of the phone, while avoiding the curved portion of the glass.


## Lift the display slightly
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the front panel and rear case.
Insert an opening pick into the gap.
The watertight adhesive holding the display in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force. If you're having a hard time opening a gap, apply more heat, and gently rock the screen up and down to weaken the adhesive until you create enough of a gap to insert your tool.",iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,244

As we all know, iPhone X and later models can easily come with Face ID failure after being dropped or water damaged. However, it should also be noted that improper operation during daily repair might also bring damage to Face ID relevant components and therefore result in Face ID failure.


###Tools Required:

## Step 1
Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Reset Face ID. When trying to setup Face ID on the iPhone, we get the message 'Face ID is Not Available, try setting up Face ID later.
Start the Camera app and select Portrait in the bottom bar. Switch to the front camera. When the camera detects a person's face, the name of the lighting effect ‘Natural Light’ stays the same. And there is also no flashing red light from the Dot Projector.
Normally, when Portrait mode is ready, the name of the lighting effect ‘Natural Light’ should turn yellow. And there is also flashing red light from the Dot Projector.


## Step 2
Let’s check Face ID parts first. Take apart the phone and take out the motherboard.
Check the earpiece speaker and sensor flex cable. Nothing goes wrong. The dot projector flex cable, the infrared camera flex cable and the front camera flex cable also haven’t been damaged.",How_To_Fix_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Face_ID_Not_Available_-_Motherboard_Repair,289
How_To_Fix_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Face_ID_Not_Available_-_Motherboard_Repair_1,"## Step 3
Let’s move on to the motherboard. Clean the motherboard with PCB Cleaner. Then run diode mode measurement of the earpiece speaker and sensor connector and the dot projector connector. The measured value is normal.
Continue measuring the infrared camera connector. Judging by the measured value, Pin 8 relevant circuit has open-circuited. Normal value should be 260 or so.


## Step 4
Outputted from PMU, the 1.8V voltage reaches Pin 8 of the infrared camera connector by way of the inductor circled in red on the bitmap.
Check relevant components of the rail. We can see that the inductor here is damaged.
Our initial judgement is that when replacing the screen, the improper operation of our client during flex cable disconnecting accidentally damaged the inductor.",How_To_Fix_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Face_ID_Not_Available_-_Motherboard_Repair,171

Remove black adhesive around first. Then apply some medium-temp solder paste to the bonding pad. Tin the bonding pad with solder paste with the help of the Soldering Iron at 365℃. Once done, clean with PCB Cleaner.
Continue to apply some rosin to the bonding pad. We can see that the damaged inductor is really small. And the replacement inductor is difficult to find.
We can solder a zero-ohm resistor instead. Get a zero-ohm resistor in the right position. Solder with Hot Air Gun at 330℃, air flow 1. Clean with PCB Cleaner afterwards.
Again, let’s run diode mode measurement of Pin 8 on the infrared camera connector. The measured value is 257, which is normal.",How_To_Fix_iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Face_ID_Not_Available_-_Motherboard_Repair,182

Now we can assemble the phone and test.
Start the Camera app. When the camera detects a person's face, the name of the lighting effect ‘Natural Light’ turns yellow. And there is also flashing red light from the Dot Projector.
Go to Settings > Face ID & Passcode > Set Up Face ID. Face ID can be setup successfully. The phone can be unlocked with Face ID this time.

In the case of a damaged or malfunctioning front camera, it is possible although difficult to replace only the front camera.

As the front camera is part of an assembly together with the infrared camera and dot projector, it is necessary to replace the front camera separately if  Face ID functionality is to be retained.

Replacing the front camera alone does not affect the function of the Face ID, while Face ID will be disabled when replacing the full front camera assembly.

Before attempting the actual replacement, a new camera should be plugged in and tested in order to verify that this repair will fix the problem.

Follow the steps in this guide to remove or transfer the earpiece speaker and front sensor assembly in your iPhone 11 Pro Max. This assembly is affixed to the back of the display and includes a microphone, ambient light sensor, flood illuminator, and proximity sensor.

'''This assembly is paired to your individual iPhone from the factory''', so you must transfer it from your old display to your new one during any display replacement.

The flood illuminator forms part of the biometric Face ID security feature, and Face ID functions will fail if the original component is damaged or incorrectly installed. Replacing it with a new part will also cause Face ID to fail, so take extra care not to damage any of these components during this procedure. If damaged, only Apple or an “Apple authorized” technician can restore Face ID function.

It’s well known that there are many videos and articles about dismantling the iPhone 11 Pro Max by teardown masters. From those teardown videos and articles, we know that the glass back of the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the toughest glass that Apple uses. If the back glass of the phone is broken, we have to remove all the components to fix it. It is very troublesome and difficult for some repairers to refurbish the phone, especially because of the triple lens camera system, which makes it much more difficult to repair the glass.

So, is there a useful and practical method to overcome this repair problem that ''doesn’t'' damage the OLED display?

There are many methods you may have attempted, including hot separation, frozen separation and more, but with little success.

Recently, FORWARD LAB has tried to use a blue light laser separation machine to repair the iPhone 11 Pro Max back glass, let’s look at how.


###Tools Required:

 - Blue Light Laser Separation Machine

 - Dust-free Cleaning Cloth

 - Manual Glue Gun


###Parts Required:

 - iPhone 11 Pro Back Glass Replacement


## Positioning and Adjust the Distance
First, place the iPhone 11 Pro Max back glass into the centered positioning mold.
Then, use a focal length rod to adjust the distance between the laser head and the back glass.",iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement,285
iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement_1,"## Positioning and Adjust the Distance
First, place the iPhone 11 Pro Max back glass into the centered positioning mold.
Then, use a focal length rod to adjust the distance between the laser head and the back glass.


## Scan The Back Glass With Laser
Close the door. Select the iPhone 11 Pro Max’s back cover drawing from the model list, then click the “Figures” key - the machine will laser the back glass automatically.
Here we can see that the machine is an enclosed structure with a window door and the laser is not exposed. You can observe the laser process at any time and it’s 100% safe and reliable during the operation.
What’s more, while the [https://www.forwardgd.com/products/rethink-blue-light-laser-separation-machine|laser machine] is working, you can release your hands to do other repair jobs. It’s very convenient.


## Separate The Back Glass - Part 1
Once the laser is finished, take out the phone and give the back glass a little tap with a focal length rob. The back glass would appear with some cracks, it would be easier to separate.
No need for too much force.",iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement,249
iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement_2,"## Separate The Back Glass - Part 2
At this time, you can use a blade and a playing card to remove the back glass.
You can see a wireless charging sensor in the middle of the phone after you remove the back glass.
Be careful of sharp glass that could cause injury. Wear gloves to avoid cutting your hands.


## Separate the Glass Around the Triple-Lens Camera
The glass around the triple-lens camera is relatively thick and the glass in this area is harder to remove. No matter how hard it is, you still can find a way to overcome it.
If you are not able to tear down the glass in this area, you can laser the glass in this area one more time.
Here, the engineer is using a blade, a grinding tool, a sculpture knife to remove the glass in this area.
You should be more patient in this step. Finally, you can take out the glass in this area successfully.


## Clean up the Residual Glue and Black Dust
After finishing the last step, clean up the residual glue and black dust with alcohol and a dustless cloth.
Now you can see the back stainless steel plate is very clean in the picture. The next step is to install the new back glass.",iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement,249
iPhone_11_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Replacement_3,"## Change a New Back Glass
Before installing the new back glass, you have to put the dustproof net back to the microphone area.
Then, add new glue onto the back stainless steel plate and laminate the new back glass to it.


## Step 8
Finally, clamp it for 30 minutes.
You can see the final effect in the below picture, that is so great.
Test the camera. Perfect.

How_To_Use_Screen_Vise_Clamps_1,"## Fit your device into a clamp
In order for the adhesive to bond correctly, you'll need to apply even pressure around the perimeter of your device.
Do not use vise clamps to forcibly close a bulging device.
Before beginning this repair, we recommend cleaning your device to avoid catching debris between the vise jaws and the device.
Open a [link|https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Screen-Vise-Clamps-6-Pack/IF145-488?o=1|screen vise clamp] and slide it over the edge of your device, as far as it will go.


## Step 2
If your device has a camera bump and the clamp is able to sit squarely over the center of a lens, you only need to use one clamp for the camera bump.
If the clamp is '''not''' able to sit squarely over the center of a lens, use two clamps spaced evenly over the camera bump.

iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_0,"# iPhone Liquid Damage Repair
Use this guide to repair your iPhone after accidental exposure to water or other liquids. Liquid damage tends to worsen with time, so it's best to get started as soon as possible. That said, liquid damage is among the more challenging DIY repairs to undertake, so if you feel unsure or need access to important data on your phone, you may want to consult with a professional before breaking out your tools.

Throughout this guide, refer to the [[Topic:iPhone|iPhone repair guides|new_window=true]] specific to your model for detailed disassembly instructions.

This guide was developed for iPhones, but the procedure for any other smartphone should be very similar.

In addition to isopropyl alcohol, you will need a container big enough to submerge your iPhone's logic board.

***Isopropyl alcohol is highly flammable.*** Perform this procedure in a well-ventilated area. Do not smoke or work near an open flame during this procedure.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,216
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_1,"***Isopropyl alcohol is highly flammable.*** Perform this procedure in a well-ventilated area. Do not smoke or work near an open flame during this procedure.

###Tools Required:

 - Detailing Brush

 - Nitrile Gloves 100 Box

 - Safety Glasses

 - Tweezers

 - Microfiber Cleaning Cloths

 - Isopropyl Alcohol (90% or Greater)


###Parts Required:

 - None",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,182
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_2,"## Step 1
Remove your iPhone from the liquid as soon as ''safely'' possible. Minimize the length of time the iPhone and liquid are in contact to minimize corrosion.
Pay attention to your personal safety first! If you are standing in water or your clothes are wet, please remove yourself from any potential shock hazard before even thinking about retrieving a submerged smartphone.
If the electronic device is still submerged and is connected to an external power source, find a safe way to disconnect it. If possible, find a circuit breaker or switch for that source of power. Use caution if you choose to remove a plug or power adapter from an outlet that has not been switched off.
Liquid damage can short-circuit the battery, creating a fire and/or chemical hazard. If you see or feel any heat, smoke, steam, bubbling, bulging, or melting, avoid handling the phone.
If your phone is still on when removed from the liquid, attempt to turn it off. If it's off, do '''not''' attempt to turn it on.
To force shut down an iPhone 6s and older, press and hold the Home and Sleep/Wake buttons until the screen turns off, and then immediately release both buttons. For the iPhone 7, press and hold the Sleep/Wake and Volume Down buttons until the screen turns off.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,277
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_3,"## Step 2
Hold the phone upright and gently tilt it from side to side to drain as much liquid through the bottom as possible.
Use a cloth to dry any liquid on the outside of the phone.


## Step 3
Remove the display and battery, using the [https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone|repair guide|new_window=true] appropriate to your model of iPhone.
Liquid damage may complicate disassembly. Beware of cables and connectors that may be ""adhered"" to other components in unexpected ways.
Be extremely careful if the battery appears damaged or swollen. If the battery shows any sign of bubbling, bulging, melting, or discoloration, gently remove it and place it in a fireproof (glass, ceramic, or metal) container for transportation to a battery recycling facility.
Even if your battery looks fine, you should not reuse a lithium-ion battery that has come into contact with liquid.
See [http://www.call2recycle.org/safety/damaged-defective-and-recalled-batteries/|this site|new_window=true] for safety guidelines regarding damaged batteries. Make sure to recycle your old battery and other e-waste at a [https://www.ifixit.com/Wiki/E-Waste|certified recycler|new_window=true].",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,295

Remove the SIM card tray:
Insert a SIM card eject tool or a paperclip into the small hole in the SIM card tray.
Push to eject the tray, then remove it from the phone.
The location of the SIM card tray may vary depending on your model of phone.


## Step 5
iPhones have liquid contact indicators (LCI)—small white stickers that turn permanently red upon contact with liquid.
Check if any of the LCIs have [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/KbwjLXXNcBTVeJIW|turned red|new_window=true] for evidence of local liquid intrusion.
The location of liquid contact indicators will vary depending on your model of iPhone. Refer to [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204104|this Apple site|new_window=true] to find the location of your phone’s LCIs.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,212
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_5,"## Step 6
If your phone was fully submerged for any amount of time, it is likely some of the internal components [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsDpALKQjUQ&feature=youtu.be&t=3m44s|corroded|new_window=true]. Corrosion looks like a white, chalky film covering metallic surfaces, and is especially prevalent on pins and connectors that carry current. Corrosion dissolves metals and will cause malfunctions in your phone.
Inspect the logic board and any connectors for [https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/6RvY2lghPrJKoVZf|signs of corrosion|new_window=true], especially in areas where the LCIs are red.
Check any external ports (charging port, headphone jack, SIM card slot, etc.) for corrosion as well. These may have to be cleaned out with alcohol and a brush, or replaced if cleaning is not practical.
If all LCIs are white, and there is no moisture or corrosion, leave the phone disassembled in a warm, dry place for a day or two to make sure any potentially trapped liquid evaporates, then reassemble the phone.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,277
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_6,"If any LCIs are red, if there is corrosion or other liquid residue, if the phone fell into dirty/acidic/sticky liquid, or if you just want to be safe, continue for more thorough cleaning.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,45
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_7,"## Step 7
Follow your iPhone's logic board replacement [[Topic:iPhone|guide|new_window=true]] to remove the logic board. If you notice corrosion or liquid residue on other parts, follow the appropriate guides to remove those as well.
If you have an iPhone 4 or earlier, you can remove the EMI shields for more thorough cleaning of the chips underneath. iPhone 5 and later models do not have removable EMI shields. If you have a newer iPhone and believe there is damage under the shields, you may need to consult a repair professional.
On an iPhone 4 or older, use a set of [product|IF145-020|tweezers] or your fingers to pull off the EMI shields.


## Step 8
Isopropyl alcohol is a mild skin and eye irritant. Use gloves and eye protection while working with isopropyl alcohol.
Fill your container with high concentration isopropyl alcohol (90% or greater) and submerge the logic board and any other components that show signs of corrosion, debris, or other liquid damage.
Do not submerge the display or camera modules, even if they are damaged. Submerging them in alcohol will likely damage them further.
Allow everything to soak for 5-10 minutes, or long enough to loosen hardened residue. Swish the parts around a little as well, to displace any trapped liquid.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,292
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_8,"## Step 9
Use a soft brush (like a toothbrush or [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Detailing-Brush/IF145-062-1|detailing brush|new_window=true]) to gently scrub away any corrosion and liquid residue on the logic board and other components.
It's possible to break small solder joints with too much force from the brush. Use just enough force to remove the corrosion and residue.
Pay special attention to cable ends, battery contacts, connectors, pins, and fuses, as these parts are prone to corrosion and can easily cause the phone to malfunction.
Keep the logic board and any other alcohol-covered components over a cloth. There's a chance the alcohol can damage or mark your work surface.
If needed, repeat steps 8 and 9 until all corrosion and residue is gone.


## Step 10
Moisten a cloth with isopropyl alcohol and wipe off the screen.
Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do to repair liquid damage inside the display itself. If damage to the display is significant, use the [https://www.ifixit.com/Device/iPhone|repair guide|new_window=true] appropriate to your phone to replace the display.
If there is any residue or corrosion on the case assembly, use the damp cloth to wipe that off as well.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,292
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_9,"## Step 11
If you were unable to remove all the EMI shields, use compressed air or a blow-dryer on its cold setting to blow underneath the shields and dry out any trapped alcohol.
When all components look clean and dry, reapply any EMI shields that you removed and begin to reassemble the phone with a new battery, and a new display if necessary.
Do not completely assemble the phone yet. Make sure internal components are screwed down and everything is plugged in, including the battery and display cables, but do not apply adhesive, screw down cover plates, replace external screws, or seat the display.
It is safe to start the phone like this, but turn the phone off before you start working inside it again. You just want to test the phone while keeping the internals accessible in case there are any problems.


## Step 12
Turn on your phone and watch for any smoke, strange noises, or burning smells. Check the battery and look for any swelling.
If something seems wrong, immediately disconnect the battery.
Test all the buttons and features (such as the microphone, speakers, wireless connectivity, camera, etc.).
Note any component or feature that doesn’t seem to be working. If anything isn’t working, disassemble the phone and check for obvious problems, such as a broken logic board component or corrosion on the cable contacts—or even an error in reassembly.",iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair,295
iPhone_Liquid_Damage_Repair_10,"## Step 13
If there are any clearly damaged components, see our other [[Topic:iPhone|iPhone guides|new_window=true]] for instructions on replacing specific [https://www.ifixit.com/Store/iPhone/iPhone|components|new_window=true].
If the problem seems to stem from a single board component or chip, a skilled microsoldering technician may be able to repair the damage.
If you can't find the source of the problem, it's possible that components under the EMI shields have been damaged. Contact a repair professional to de-solder the shields and give the board an ultrasonic cleaning bath.
If everything is working, congratulations! Go ahead and reassemble your phone.

## Locate the adhesive strips
The battery is secured to the rear case with four pieces of stretch-release adhesive—two on the bottom edge of the battery, and two on the top edge.
Each piece of adhesive has a black pull-tab at the end, which is lightly adhered to the edge of the battery.
In the following steps, you'll pull each tab to slowly stretch out the adhesive underneath the battery. These ""command-strip"" style adhesives lose their stick when stretched, so you can remove the battery with ease.
If the strips break, don't panic! They don't always work as intended. Keep reading for tips on removing broken strips.


## Remove the stretch-release adhesive
Peel down the first battery adhesive pull-tab to un-stick it from the bottom edge of the battery.
Space is tight around some parts of the battery. It may help to slide an opening pick between the battery and its adhesive to help separate the adhesive.

Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive.
Use an opening pick or the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.",iPhone_12_Pro_Max_Battery_Replacement,237

[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baHX1yrDKbY&t=248s]

It is well known that Apple has added MagSafe to the iPhone 12 series. While trying to separate the back glass, we found that the magnets were glued to the back glass. Undoubtedly, the difficulty to refurbish the iPhone 12 series back glass has accordingly increased. Thanks to our rich experience and proper tools, we finally figured out the right way to fix the iPhone 12 back glass.

# Disassemble the phone and remove the wireless charging coil.
# After that, scan the back glass with laser except for the camera area.
# Then we remove the magnet array and the back glass.
# Put on the new back glass with enlarged camera holes.
# Stick the magnet array and shield to the new back glass.
The foregoing guide gives you a clear and correct guide about how to replace the iPhone 12 back glass.

However, the journey to search the right way was not easy. We made the first attempt and almost failed. Scroll down and you will see what challenges we have come across.


###Tools Required:

###Parts Required:

 - None",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,259
iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_1,"## Laser Marking
Put the back glass of iPhone 12 under the focus positioning probe of the laser marking machine. After positioning, mark the back glass area except for the camera and wireless charging area. We haven't marked the wireless charging area to avoid damage.


## Back Glass Separation
A new member, Glass Breaking Pen, is coming to our back glass refurbishing tools family. Break the back glass with Glass Breaking Pen and remove the shards with Pry Bar.
When breaking the wireless charging area, you can see that the magnets are glued to the glass. Hence the back glass fix solution of iPhone 11 is not suitable for iPhone 12.
If we stick to our old method, all magnets will fall off and become separate. The subsequent recovering process will be harder. In addition, we can’t mark the wireless charging area directly with a laser to avoid damage.


## Back Glass Separation
We should remove the wireless charging coil and then mark. The magnet array and shield can be easily removed after marking.


## Back Glass Separation
Then we remove the glass around the camera. Please do not touch the camera lens.
After the glass is completely removed, mark the back again to remove residual adhesive.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,245
iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_2,"## Back Glass Separation
Then we remove the glass around the camera. Please do not touch the camera lens.
After the glass is completely removed, mark the back again to remove residual adhesive.


## Back Glass Gluing
Clamp a new back glass with enlarged camera holes down to the middle frame first to see if it fits.
Apply some adhesive evenly on the middle frame. Put the back glass in position and press it gently against the middle frame.


## Back Glass Gluing
Press the back glass further against the middle frame with Press Clamp.
The adhesive has set after 10 minutes. Take the back cover out. Check if the gap is too large, if there is adhesive overflow, and if the fit is smooth.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,154
iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_3,"## Back Glass Gluing
After the back glass gluing is finished, we install the magnet array and shield. Apply some B-7000 Adhesive on the magnet circle to adhere the magnet array to the back.
Please make sure that the opening of the magnet array is placed in the right position as in the picture.
Stick the magnet that we accidentally cut out back on and glue the alignment magnet.
Last but not least, assemble the phone and test the MagSafe function. The MagSafe function is normal.
In conclusion, MagSafe is added to the iPhone 12 series, which makes it harder to refurbish the back glass. Since the magnets are glued to the back glass, we need to detach the magnets before removing the back glass. Therefore, the iPhone 12 series currently don’t support the back glass separating without disassembling. The wireless charging coil needs to be removed first. Then we can separate the back glass by marking the back glass except for the camera area. The success rate of the foregoing method is higher. But the method can be not only demanding but also has a high requirement for the technician. We will continuously make a painstaking effort to seek the best iPhone 12 back glass refurbishing solution and even the back glass separating without disassembling. Please stay tuned.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,276

Each piece of adhesive has a black pull-tab at the end, which is lightly adhered to the edge of the battery.
In the following steps, you'll pull each tab to slowly stretch out the adhesive underneath the battery. These ""command-strip"" style adhesives lose their stick when stretched, so you can remove the battery with ease.
If the strips break, don't panic! They don't always work as intended. Keep reading for tips on removing broken strips.


## Remove the stretch-release adhesive
Caution: Don't jab the battery with any sharp tools. A punctured battery may leak dangerous chemicals or catch fire.

Don't press down on the battery. Hold the iPhone firmly by its sides.
Keep the strip flat and unwrinkled. Try to pull evenly on the whole strip, rather than pulling mainly in the middle or on one side.
Pull at a low angle so the strip doesn't snag on the edge of the battery.

'''Caution:''' Before you begin, discharge your iPhone battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 6.8 mm-long pentalobe P2 screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Opening the iPhone's display will compromise its waterproof seals. Have replacement seals ready before you proceed past this step, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iPhone without replacing the seals.


## Mark your opening picks
If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage.
Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker.
You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements.

A rubber gasket on the bottom of the Lightning connector protects your iPhone from liquid and dust intrusion. If you are installing a new Lightning connector assembly, you may need to carefully remove and transfer the gasket to the new part.
The small adhesive patch on the bottom of each microphone also protects your iPhone from liquid and dust intrusion. For best results, replace the two adhesive patches before installing your Lightning connector assembly.
Check if your new part comes with an antenna converter cable. If it doesn't, use the pointed end of your spudger to pry up and transfer the cable from your old Lightning assembly to the new one.
If possible, turn on your device and test your repair before installing new adhesive and resealing.

Compare your new replacement part to the original part—you may need to transfer other remaining components or remove additional adhesive backings from the new part before installing.

Use this guide to remove, transfer, or replace the home/touch ID sensor a.k.a the home button in an iPhone SE 2022.

This guide was performed on the ***A2783*** (international) model.

The iPhone SE 2022’s home “button” is actually a solid-state sensor, which also includes Touch ID (fingerprint recognition) capability.

***Most replacement home buttons won’t work***, so check carefully before starting your repair. Your iPhone’s original home button is uniquely paired to the logic board at the factory—and without Apple’s proprietary calibration process, even a genuine replacement home button from another iPhone won’t work. To fix a broken home button, you should install a specially-made, universal-style home button. Note that these replacements only work as a button and you'll loose Touch ID functionality.

If you are only replacing a broken screen, you can use this guide to carefully remove and transfer your working original home button to a new screen, preserving all functions, including Touch ID.",iPhone_SE_2022_Home/Touch_ID_Sensor_Replacement,238

Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 6.8 mm-long pentalobe P2 screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.


## Mark your opening picks
If inserted too far, an opening pick can damage your device. Follow this step to mark your pick and prevent damage.
Measure 3 mm from the tip and mark the opening pick with a permanent marker.
You can also mark the other corners of the pick with different measurements.

iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_6,"## Step 2
If you're reinstalling your existing screen, be sure to remove any remaining adhesive from the back of your screen as well.


## Step 3
Using a lint-free cloth (or coffee filter) and some high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol, clean the areas of the frame and screen where you removed the old adhesive.
For best results, swipe your cleaning cloth in one direction, not back and forth.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.


## Step 5
Grasp the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,275
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_7,"## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of your iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip into place.


## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,284
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_8,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner—the pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PVXOAEQsFPoENVM.full|liners covering the perimeter|new_window=true], which prevent the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,151
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_9,"## Reconnect the screen

To re-attach [guide|25629|wide press connectors|stepid=70308|new_window=true] like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage.
Press down and connect the front sensor connector.
Align the connector carefully over its socket and press down with your fingertip until it clicks into place. Don't try to force the connector into place. If you're having trouble, reposition it and try again.
***This is a good time to power on your iPhone and test all functions before you seal it up. ***Be sure to power your iPhone back down completely before you continue.
If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again.


## Install the connector covers
Tuck the display connector cover's tab into its frame cutout and lay the cover in place.
Repeat with the front sensor connector cover.


## Step 12
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the two connector covers.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,277
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_10,"## Step 12
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the two connector covers.


## Remove the final liners
While supporting the screen, use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.
Be careful not to touch the exposed adhesive.
Check the frame and screen for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining.


## Install the screen onto the frame
Carefully align the screen's top clips with their frame cutouts.


## Step 15
Lower the screen onto the frame, beginning with the top edge.
If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips.
Make sure the screen edge isn't pinching any cables.


## Apply heat to the perimeter
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or an [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] to heat the screen perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch.
The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,277
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement_11,"## Apply pressure to the perimeter
Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone.


## Step 2
Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface.
Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish.
Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions.
Alternatively, you can use [guide|142291|vise clamps] around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive.


## Step 3
Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone.
The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable.
Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes.
The pressure will help activate the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Replacement,173

Use this guide to replace the battery in your iPhone 16 Plus.

You'll need replacement back glass and battery adhesive to complete this repair. If your replacement battery does not include adhesive, use [product|IF145-458|stretch release battery adhesive|new_window=true] instead.

iPhone batteries are rated to hold 80% of their capacity for up to 500 charge cycles, or roughly 18–24 months. If your iPhone needs to be charged more often or runs slower, it might be time to replace the battery.

This iPhone uses a battery adhesive that requires an electrical charge to loosen it. [link|https://support.apple.com/en-us/120671|Apple's repair manual|new_window=true] recommends connecting a 9V battery for 90 seconds, but you can use a power supply or a power bank at a 5–20V output instead—the time required to loosen the adhesive will vary.",iPhone_16_Plus_Battery_Replacement,210

''Not all USB-C PD power sources support 12 V'' (the FixHub Portable Power Station does). If the source doesn't support 12 V, the VoltClip will operate at the next lowest voltage—usually 9 V. This voltage is still sufficient to debond the adhesive. If you're using a different method, follow the guide normally and supplement your power source's operating procedures during the necessary steps.

After completing this repair, you may receive warnings about your replacement part and lose access to battery health data, but your new battery will otherwise work normally. As of iOS 18.1, battery health works with both genuine and aftermarket replacement batteries.

## Weighing the iPhone 16e
The iPhone 16e weighs 166.1 grams, which is lighter than the other iPhone 16 models, and even standard for modern smartphones.


## Dissemble the Phone
Remove the two Pentalobe screws located at the bottom of the phone.
Place the iPhone face up on a heating mat to loosen the adhesive holding the back cover in place.
Use a phone opening tool to create a gap between the back cover and the middle frame.",iPhone_16e_Disassembly,232
iPhone_16e_Disassembly_1,"## Opening the Back Cover
Insert a pick into the gap and slide it along to open the device.
Open the iPhone by swinging the back cover up
Disconnect the battery cable and wireless charging coil cable, then remove the back cover.
The internal design looks very similar to the iPhone 15


## Removing the Battery
Disconnect the SIM holder base cable first.
The battery itself does not have pull tabs; instead, it uses a special adhesive that releases when an electric current is applied.
According to Apple, the new internal structure allows the iPhone 16e to accommodate a larger battery. In our observations, the smaller camera makes room for a larger battery.
The iPhone 16e has a 4005mAh battery, which is larger and more powerful than the iPhone 15.


## Front Camera Removal
Disconnect the flex cable
Remove the SIM tray
Remove front camera assembly
The iPhone 16e's front camera is essentially the same as the iPhone 14 because there is no Dynamic Island.


## Rear Camera Removal
Remove the screws securing the rear camera
The iPhone 16e features a 48-megapixel sensor paired with a 2x telephoto lens.
There is no wide-angle camera and LiDAR on it, so it cannot be used for ultra-wide shots, cinematic mode, spatial video, or macros.",iPhone_16e_Disassembly,270
iPhone_16e_Disassembly_2,"## Disassembling the Motherboard
Remove the screws and take out the earpiece.
Remove the taptic engine and speaker.
Remove the motherboard screws and flip off the motherboard.
In the iPhone 16e, the motherboard is connected to the display cable and proximity sensor cable. Make sure you disconnect them properly.


## Removing the Screen
Remove the sim holder base, antenna, and charging port flex cable before removing the screen.
Once again, place the iPhone face down on the heating mat.
Use a phone opening tool or a suction cup to create a gap between the screen and the middle frame.
Insert a pick into the gap and slide it. Swing the screen and open it.
The iPhone 16e features a 6.1-inch OLED display. What's interesting is that the screen connector on the iPhone 16e is the same as the iPhone 14. We tested this by swapping the screen onto an iPhone 14, and it worked perfectly, suggesting cross-compatibility between the two models.",iPhone_16e_Disassembly,211
iPhone_16e_Disassembly_3,"## Exploring the New C1 Chip
Use heat and separate the motherboard.
In the middle layer, the solder pads are wider, and the component distribution is less compact, which simplifies the layering process.
The A18 chip has made CPU repair more challenging because it is embedded deeper. The Apple C1 chip is Apple's first in-house cellular modem, utilizing 4-nanometer baseband technology and 7-nanometer transceiver technology. It is described as the most power-efficient modem ever integrated into an iPhone, resulting in longer battery life.",iPhone_16e_Disassembly,119
