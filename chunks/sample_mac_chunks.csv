Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors_15,"## Display Cable Connectors
Display (sometimes called eDP cables in laptops) and camera cable connectors often have a small metal buckle running around the socket, locking them in place. The connectors are typically wide and may have tape attached to the buckle.
Disconnecting these cables is a two-step process. First, gently push the tip of a spudger under the metal buckle to unclip it, then swing it over the socket.
Next, hold the buckle and cable ''together'' and gently pull the connector straight out of its socket.
To reconnect:
Grip the cable and buckle together and insert the connector fully into its socket.
Aligning the connector can be tricky. Reposition it as necessary and don't try to force it into the socket, or you may damage both the connector and its socket.
Flip the buckle over the socket and use a spudger to press the buckle down until it clicks into place.",Recognizing_&_Disconnecting_Cable_Connectors,197,camera,True
Repair_a_Magic_Mouse_After_a_Battery_Leak_3,"## Gently Separate the Top and Bottom Halves
You have removed the aluminum shell that was glued onto the bottom of Apple's Magic Mouse.
What you have left with are the upper and lower halves of the mouse.  They are held together by four tiny black plastic posts on the bottom half, that are inserted into plastic loops on the top half.  ***WARNING***:  Proceed with caution.  If you break any of these black plastic posts or loops, it might be game over.
The two halves are connected by a wide ribbon cable that is somewhat fragile.  ***WARNING:*** If you tear this cable it is game over for this mouse.
Proceeding with caution, take a small pry tool and pry one of the plastic loops off of its black plastic post.  Pry the loop in the outboard direction while applying gentle pressure separating the upper and lower halves of the mouse.  The loop should pop off the black plastic post.
Continue to release each of the remaining three black plastic posts.  Remember that on the Apple logo end of the mouse there is a fragile ribbon cable that you dare not tear.
Once you release the black plastic posts, the only thing holding the mouse together is a very fragile ribbon cable [see second photo].  ***WARNING:*** You don't want to tear the cable or pull it out of its socket (because it is tricky to put it back into the socket).  Proceed with care!",Repair_a_Magic_Mouse_After_a_Battery_Leak,295,camera,True

###Tools Required:

 - Spudger

 - Metal Spudger


###Parts Required:

 - None


## Finding the switch
Firstly flip your mouse upside down and find the power switch. It is located just above the Apple logo and looks like a sliding door.


## Switching off the mouse
Slide the power switch to the off position or until it fully covers the optical sensor.


## Opening the battery door
Locate the clip holding the battery cover on the mouse and use a sputter or your nail to push it aside to allow the door to spring up.
This can take a few attempts especially if your mouse is well used and trying different approaches may get it to open up. For mine I had to slightly push the door down to open it.
Once the door pops up remove it but keep it close.


## How the switch works
The Mighty Mouse's on off switch works by the plastic slider on the door pushing down a bent piece of metal to then press a button on the main chassis of the mouse. (photo 1)
Over time the metal (photo 2) can bend to far down and not press the chassis button (photo 3) .",How_to_Fix_Apple_Mighty_Mouse_Power_Button,246,camera,True
