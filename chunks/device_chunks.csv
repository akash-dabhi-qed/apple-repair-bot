* ***A2221***
* ***A2223***

You can find the model number through the phone's UI by going to the ***Settings*** app and navigating to ***General*** > ***About***. Tap on the number listed in the ***Model Number*** section and it should change to a format that looks like the numbers above.",iPhone_11,241
iPhone_11_2,"The iPhone 11 features a 6.1 in (diagonal) glass screen with curved edges, thin black bezels, and a notch at the top of the screen to accommodate a speaker and selfie camera. The back cover is glass and the edge frame is made from curved and anodized aluminum.

Volume controls can be found on the left edge while the power button and SIM card tray are situated on the right. A rectangular camera ""bump"" containing two vertically-aligned cameras protrudes slightly from the back case. This model has no home button.

The iPhone 11 can be differentiated from the iPhone 12 by the 11's curved edges relative to the flat edges on the iPhone 12.

###Tools Required:

 - P2 Pentalobe Screwdriver iPhone

 - iOpener

 - iFixit Opening Picks (Set of 6)

 - Suction Handle

 - Clampy - Anti-Clamp

 - Tri-point Y000 Screwdriver

 - Spudger

## Remove the pentalobe screws
Before you begin, discharge your iPhone battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 6.7 mm-long pentalobe screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Opening the iPhone's display will compromise its waterproof seals. Have replacement seals ready before you proceed past this step, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iPhone without replacing the seals.",Display_Assembly,214
Display_Assembly_1,"## Tape over any cracks
If your iPhone has a cracked screen, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping over the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's screen until the whole face is covered.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.
If you can't get the suction cup to stick in the next few steps, fold a strong piece of tape (such as duct tape) into a handle and lift the screen with that instead.
If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the screen.",Display_Assembly,130
Display_Assembly_2,"## Anti-Clamp instructions
The next three steps demonstrate the [product|IF145-513|Anti-Clamp], a tool we designed to make the opening procedure easier. ***If you aren't using the Anti-Clamp, skip down three steps for an alternate method.***
For complete instructions on how to use the Anti-Clamp, [guide|152309|check out this guide|new_window=true].
Pull the blue handle backwards to unlock the Anti-Clamp's arms.
Slide the arms over either the left or right edge of your iPhone.
Position the suction cups near the bottom edge of the iPhone—one on the top, and one on the bottom.
Squeeze the cups together to apply suction to the desired area.
If you find that the surface of your iPhone is too slippery for the Anti-Clamp to hold onto, you can [guide|159595|use tape|new_window=true] to create a grippier surface.


## Step 3
Pull the blue handle forward to lock the arms.
Turn the handle clockwise 360 degrees or until the cups start to stretch.
Make sure the suction cups remain aligned with each other. If they begin to slip out of alignment, loosen the suction cups slightly and realign the arms.",Display_Assembly,277
Display_Assembly_3,"## Step 4
[guide|25705|Heat an iOpener|new_window=true] and thread it through the arms of the Anti-Clamp.
You can also use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or hot plate—but extreme heat can damage the display and/or internal battery, so proceed with care.
Fold the iOpener so it lays on the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Wait one minute to give the adhesive a chance to release and present an opening gap.
Insert an opening pick into the gap under the screen and the plastic bezel, ***not the screen itself.***
If the Anti-Clamp doesn't create a sufficient gap, apply more heat to the area and rotate the handle a quarter turn.
Don't crank more than a quarter turn at a time, and wait one minute between turns. Let the Anti-Clamp and time do the work for you.
***Skip the next three steps.***",Display_Assembly,235
Display_Assembly_4,"## Heat the lower edge of the phone
Heating the lower edge of the iPhone helps soften the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open.
Use a hairdryer or heat gun or [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iOpener+Heating/25705|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] and apply it to the lower edge of the iPhone for about a minute.


## Step 6

Display_Assembly_5,"## Step 6
If you're using a single suction handle, apply it to the bottom edge of the phone, while avoiding the curved portion of the glass.


## Lift the display slightly
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the front panel and rear case.
Insert an opening pick into the gap under the [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/wIr4Mt4kTQPHBIOX.full|screen and the plastic bezel|new_window=true], ***not the screen itself.***
The watertight adhesive holding the display in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force. ***If you're having a hard time opening a gap, apply more heat, and gently rock the screen up and down to weaken the adhesive*** until you create enough of a gap to insert your tool.


## Separate the screen adhesive
Slide the opening pick around the lower left corner and up the left edge of the iPhone, slicing through the adhesive holding the display in place.
Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage internal components.",Display_Assembly,263

Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage the display cables.


## Step 11
The top edge of the display is secured with both glue and clips.
Gently pull the right edge of the display '''''down''''' slightly (in the direction of the Lightning port).
Insert your pick into the top-right corner of the phone.


## Step 12
Continue pulling the display down (toward the Lightning port) as needed in order to make a gap large enough for the pick.
Slide the pick to the top left corner and cut any remaining adhesive securing the display.
Don't insert your pick more than 3 mm, as you may damage the Face ID sensor array.


## Remove the suction cup
Pull the small nub on the suction cup to detach it from the front panel.",Display_Assembly,244

Pull the small nub on the suction cup to detach it from the front panel.


## Open the iPhone
Open the iPhone by swinging the display up from the left side, like the back cover of a book.
Don't try to fully separate the display yet, as several fragile ribbon cables still connect it to the iPhone's logic board.
Prop the display up against something sturdy.
During reassembly, lay the display in position, align the clips along the top edge, and carefully press the top edge into place before snapping the rest of the display down. If it doesn't click easily into place, check the condition of the clips around the perimeter of the display and make sure they aren't bent.

This minty green machine may be the middle sibling in this year’s iPhone lineup, but it’s no less worthy of time under the screwdriver.
As usual, the specs tell part of the story, and hopefully a teardown will tell the rest. Here's what we know going in:
A13 Bionic SoC with a third-generation Neural Engine
6.1-inch (1792 x 828) 326 ppi Liquid Retina LCD with True Tone and P3 wide color gamut support
Not one, but two 12 MP rear cameras (wide and ultra-wide), and a 12 MP selfie camera paired with TrueDepth Face ID hardware

With the rear case nearly hollowed out, we finish with an X-ray that leaves us with a few lingering questions. Despite the lack of a second battery connector, we can’t help but stare at this charging coil and wonder what might have been.
If bilateral charging were included in the final production design, we wouldn’t necessarily expect to see a radically altered coil—but a bigger battery and additional thermal management would almost certainly be required, as reverse wireless charging is thirsty and inefficient, throwing off a lot of heat.
In the case of this iPhone 11, we’re not ''really'' seeing either of those things.
Perhaps related to the missing second battery connector, we also see the omission of the new [https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+11+Pro+Max+Teardown/126000#s243572|battery charging board|new_wndow=true] we found in the Pro Max.

Pro or no, all 2019 iPhones are shipping with stacked-PCB logic boards for maximum density and space efficiency.
Unlike its Pro siblings, the vanilla 11 gets a very modest 7% battery capacity increase.

## iPhone 11 Black Screen/ No Display Backlight Repair
First of all, we need to install the motherboard. Connect the screen and battery to the motherboard.
Press the power button to turn on the phone. The Apple logo is vaguely visible. The phone can be turned on but the backlight is not working.


## Step 2
Remove the screen and disconnect the battery. Measure diode values of pin 26, 24, 22, 20, 18, and 16 on J8000 with diode mode of the multimeter. Pin 24 and 18 have no diode values. The normal value should be around 400-500. It can be preliminarily judged that the circuits of the two pins have open circuits.
Since relevant components of the two pins are under the shielding cover, we need to remove the shielding cover. Protect the connectors with high-temperature tape.",iPhone_11_Black_Screen/_No_Display_Backlight_Repair,249
iPhone_11_Black_Screen/_No_Display_Backlight_Repair_1,"## Step 3
Heat the shielding cover with Hot Air Gun at 380 °C and airflow 60. Pry up the shielding cover with a Sculpture Knife. It can be seen under the microscope that R5651 and R5661 are burnt out.


## Step 4
Apply some Paste Flux.
Remove the resistors with Hot Air Gun at 360 °C and airflow 40.
Apply some middle-temperature Solder Paste. Keep heating with Hot Air Gun. Because we haven’t found resistors of the same size, we use the iPhone 7 backlight protection inductors for alternatives. Heat with Hot Air Gun to solder the inductors.


## Step 5
After the motherboard has cooled, remove the high-temperature tape. Measure with multimeter. The diode values of pin 24 and 18 return to normal.
Next, we install the motherboard. The phone can be turned on. The display is working properly.
iPhone 11 with no backlight has been successfully repaired.

###Parts Required:

 - iPhone 11 Rear Camera


## Step 1
Today, REWA LAB will share with you a repair case of an iPhone camera and  walk you through some knowledge of iPhone camera repair.
Open the phone camera. When taking photos with the wide-angle camera, cracks appear. The ultra-wide camera works fine. We can judge that the optical filter of the wide-angle camera is damaged.


## Step 2
We can judge that the optical filter of the wide-angle camera is damaged. Then we disassemble the phone and try to repair the camera. First of all, put the camera on the specialized Heating Platform at 100 °C.
When the temperature reaches 100 °C,  remove black adhesive around the camera with a Sculpture Knife. Then pry up the wide-angle camera.
Attach the camera to the specialized holder. Before repair, apply protection tape to the camera.",iPhone_Camera_Repair,230
iPhone_Camera_Repair_1,"## Step 3
Separate the camera edges with a Sculpture Knife. Next, remove the metal cover with Hot Air Gun at 120 °C.
Keep heating with Hot Air Gun at 120 °C. Remove black adhesive with [product|IF145-020|Tweezers]. Apply some Paste Flux.
Separate the motor from the CMOS with ultrathin Soldering Iron at 380 °C


## Step 4
It can be seen that the optical filter is broken while the motor and blue lens are good. If the motor is damaged, the camera will fail to focus or shake. A motor replacement can help you solve the problem.
The middle part of the motor is the blue lens. If the blue lens is damaged, the camera will become blurry. The solution is to replace the blue lens.
Then we replace the cracked optical filter with a new one.


## Step 5

[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxKr0gJVpJ8&t=31s]


###Tools Required:

 - None


###Parts Required:

 - None


## Step 1
Recently, Phone Repair Guru posted a video about iPhone 13 screen replacement. After replacement, “Important Display Message” pops up. What’s worse, Face ID is not available. Since the iPhone 13 screen includes no flood illuminator module and all the parts for the TrueDepth system are housed in the iPhone itself.
REWA LAB speculates that the chip on the original screen has saved Face ID data. Transferring the chip to the new screen might solve the problem. Today, let’s verify this speculation


## Step 2
In the first place, we test the Face ID function of iPhone 13. True Tone function is normal. Face ID can be set up and is working fine
Then we disassemble the phone and try to replace the screen with an original and genuine one. Remove the original screen.


## Step 3
Detach the sensor flex cable with Hot Air Gun at 100 °C. Please be careful not to damage the flex cable when you remove it .
Attach the removed sensor flex cable to the new screen. Install the screws. Connect the new screen. Turn on the phone.",How_to_Fix_iPhone_13_Face_ID_Not_Working,288
How_to_Fix_iPhone_13_Face_ID_Not_Working_1,"## Step 4
“Important Display Message” appears. Face ID can’t be set up. True Tone disappears.


## Step 5
Next, we try to transfer the IC on the original screen to the new screen. Remove the new screen. To prevent scratches on the screen during operations,  apply a protective film to the screen.
Heat the screen flex cable with Hot Air Gun at 100 °C. Gently pull up the flex cable.
To protect the screen, insert the reballing stencil under the flex cable for insulation.


## Step 6
Apply high-temperature tape.
Remove black adhesive around the chip with Hot Air Gun at 240 °C.
To remove the chip, set the temperature to 300 °C and airflow to 6 .


## Step 7
Apply some middle-temperature Solder Paste.
Clean the bonding pads with Soldering Iron at 360 °C and solder wick.
Keep cleaning the bonding pads with PCB Cleaner.",How_to_Fix_iPhone_13_Face_ID_Not_Working,191
How_to_Fix_iPhone_13_Face_ID_Not_Working_2,"## Step 7
Apply some middle-temperature Solder Paste.
Clean the bonding pads with Soldering Iron at 360 °C and solder wick.
Keep cleaning the bonding pads with PCB Cleaner.


## Step 8
Next, remove the chip on the original screen with the same method.
Clean tin on the chip of the original screen. Apply some middle-temperature Solder Paste to the bonding pads. Clean tin and black adhesive on the bonding pads of the chip with Solder Wick. Keep cleaning the bonding pads with PCB Cleaner.
Next, reball the chip. Put the reballing stencil in position. Apply a layer of middle-temperature Solder Paste evenly.


## Step 9
After the solder balls are formed, clean with PCB cleaner. Apply Paste Flux to the bonding pads of the new screen.
Align the chip of the original screen. Solder the chip with Hot Air Gun at 300 °C. Remove high-temperature tape after the flex cable has cooled.


## Step 10
Connect the screen. Turn on the phone. There is no “Important Display Message”.
Face ID can be set up and is working fine. But True Tone hasn’t been restored.

## Remove the leftover adhesive
Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation,224
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation_1,"## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.


## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation,207
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation_2,"## Step 5
Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.


## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation,161
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation_3,"## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation,211
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Back_Glass_Installation_4,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass

## Remove the adhesive and its residue
Use a spudger or tweezers to remove the adhesive chunks from the iPhone's frame.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.


## Step 2
If you're reinstalling your existing screen, be sure to remove any remaining adhesive from the back of your screen as well.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation,181
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation_1,"## Step 2
If you're reinstalling your existing screen, be sure to remove any remaining adhesive from the back of your screen as well.


## Step 3
Using a lint-free cloth (or coffee filter) and some high concentration (>90%) isopropyl alcohol, clean the areas of the frame and screen where you removed the old adhesive.
For best results, swipe your cleaning cloth in one direction, not back and forth.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.


## Step 5
Grasp the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation,275
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation_2,"## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of your iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip into place.


## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation,284
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation_3,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner—the pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have [link|https://guide-images.cdn.ifixit.com/igi/5PVXOAEQsFPoENVM.full|liners covering the perimeter|new_window=true], which prevent the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation,151

If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again.


## Install the connector covers
Tuck the display connector cover's tab into its frame cutout and lay the cover in place.
Repeat with the front sensor connector cover.


## Step 12
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the two connector covers.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation,277
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Screen_Installation_5,"## Step 12
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the two 1.3 mm‑long screws securing the two connector covers.


## Remove the final liners
While supporting the screen, use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.
Be careful not to touch the exposed adhesive.
Check the frame and screen for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining.


## Install the screen onto the frame
Carefully align the screen's top clips with their frame cutouts.


## Step 15
Lower the screen onto the frame, beginning with the top edge.
If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips.
Make sure the screen edge isn't pinching any cables.


## Apply heat to the perimeter
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or an [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] to heat the screen perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch.

Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_5G_mmWave_Antenna_Replacement,161
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_5G_mmWave_Antenna_Replacement_11,"## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_5G_mmWave_Antenna_Replacement,211
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_5G_mmWave_Antenna_Replacement_12,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.


## Step 11
Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board.

## Remove the leftover adhesive
Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.


## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement,237
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement_14,"## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.


## Step 5
Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement,222
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement_15,"## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.


## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement,286
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Charge_Port_Replacement_16,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.


## Step 11

Use a Phillips screwdriver to install the two screws securing the LiDAR sensor:
One 1.6 mm‑long screw
One 2.9 mm‑long screw


## Step 3
Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the LiDAR sensor connector to the logic board.
To re-attach [guide|25629|press connectors|stepid=70308|new_window=true] like this one, carefully align and press down on one side until it clicks into place, then repeat on the other side. Don't press down in the middle. If the connector is misaligned, the pins can bend, causing permanent damage.


## Remove the leftover adhesive
Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,287
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_8,"## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.


## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,207
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_9,"## Step 5
Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.


## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,161
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_10,"## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,211
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_11,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.


## Step 11
Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board.


## Connect the battery
Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board.
***This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. ***Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly.
If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again.
If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the [guide|178634|screen guide|new_window=true] to manually connect the display connector.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,287
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_12,"## Install the connector covers
Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place.

One 1.0 mm‑long screw


## Remove the final adhesive liners
Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.
As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive.
Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining.


## Step 18
Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge.
If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips.
Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement,268
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_LiDAR_Sensor_Replacement_13,"## Apply heat to the perimeter
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or an [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch.
The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond.


## Apply pressure to the perimeter
Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone.


## Step 2
Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface.
Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish.
Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions.
Alternatively, you can use [guide|142291|vise clamps] around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive.


## Step 3
Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone.
The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable.

Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the earpiece speaker and the mmWave connectors onto the logic board.


## Remove the leftover adhesive
Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.


## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement,245
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement_13,"## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.


## Step 5
Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement,222
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement_14,"## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.


## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement,286
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement_15,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.


## Step 11
Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board.

## Remove the final adhesive liners
Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.
As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive.
Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining.


## Step 18
Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge.
If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips.
Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Logic_Board_Replacement,268

Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or an [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch.
The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond.


## Apply pressure to the perimeter
Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone.


## Step 2
Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface.
Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish.
Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions.
Alternatively, you can use [guide|142291|vise clamps] around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive.


## Step 3
Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone.

Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Rear_Camera_Assembly_Replacement,287
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Rear_Camera_Assembly_Replacement_9,"## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.


## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.

If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Rear_Camera_Assembly_Replacement,211
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Rear_Camera_Assembly_Replacement_12,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.

Use your finger or a spudger to press the assembly cable connector onto the logic board.


## Remove the leftover adhesive
Work around the fragile grounding clips as you're cleaning the frame. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Use [product|IF145-020-4|blunt nose tweezers] or your fingers to remove large pieces of adhesive from the frame perimeter.
Use a spudger to scrape the adhesive residue off of the frame.
If the adhesive feels stubborn, apply some heat using a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] and try again.


## Clean the back glass
If you're reusing your back glass, apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to a [product|IF145-284|microfiber] or lint-free cloth and wipe around the perimeter to prepare the surface for new adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,237
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement_10,"## Clean the frame
Wrap a lint-free cloth or a coffee filter over the point of a spudger and apply a few drops of highly-concentrated isopropyl alcohol (over 90%) to it.
Wipe in one direction along the perimeter of the frame to clean the adhesive residue.
Take your time doing this. A clean frame allows replacement adhesive to lay evenly, ensuring a better bond.


## Apply the replacement adhesive
Lay the adhesive sheet over the frame to determine its proper orientation.
Use features such as the camera cutout and notches along the top and bottom edges to visualize how the adhesive will lay in the frame.


## Step 5
Grab the tab in the corner of the adhesive sheet and peel the liner to expose ***a third ***of the adhesive.
The exposed adhesive is very sticky. Don't let it touch anything until you're ready to apply it to the frame.
If your adhesive has multiple liners, peel the liner that exposes the side that sticks to the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,222
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement_11,"## Step 6
Carefully align the exposed edge of the adhesive strip with the corresponding edge of the iPhone's frame.
Once the adhesive is pressed into place, you can't reposition it—you'll have to remove it and start over with new adhesive.
When it's correctly aligned, gently press the exposed adhesive strip onto the frame.


## Step 7
Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,286
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement_12,"## Step 9
Use a spudger or your fingers to lift the pull tab connected to the large front liner. The pull tab is often in a corner of the liner.
Use the pull tab to peel off the large front liner from the adhesive.
At this point, you may still have liner covering the perimeter, which prevents the adhesive from accidentally sticking to anything while you're reassembling your iPhone. ***Don't remove these small release liners just yet.***


## Connect the back glass
Prop up the back glass along the right edge of your iPhone.


## Step 11
Use your finger or the flat end of a spudger to press and connect the back glass connector onto the logic board.


## Connect the battery
Use your finger or a spudger to press and connect the battery press connector onto the logic board.
***This is a good point to test your repair before sealing up your iPhone. ***Power on your iPhone and make sure it works as expected. Power it back down and continue reassembly.
If your iPhone doesn't turn on, connect it to a power source and try again.
If you've replaced the logic board and the screen fails to turn on, you'll need to follow the [guide|178634|screen guide|new_window=true] to manually connect the display connector.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,287
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement_13,"## Install the connector covers
Align the back glass connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place.


## Step 14
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the four screws securing the back glass connector cover:
Two 1.3 mm‑long screws
Two 1.0 mm‑long screws


## Step 15
Align the battery connector cover by its screw holes and lay it in place.


## Step 16
Use a tri-point Y000 driver to install the three screws securing the battery connector cover:
Two 1.3 mm‑long screws
One 1.0 mm‑long screw


## Remove the final adhesive liners
Use your fingers or a spudger to peel away all perimeter liners, exposing the adhesive.
As you remove the liners, make sure nothing touches the exposed adhesive.
Check the frame and back glass for any stray liners and remove them. There should be no liners remaining.


## Step 18
Lower the back glass onto the frame, beginning with the top edge.
If you feel resistance, a perimeter clip may have bent out of place and is being crushed by the frame. Look at the point of resistance and gently straighten any bent clips.
Press along the edges of the iPhone until the back glass sits flush against the frame.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,268
iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement_14,"## Apply heat to the perimeter
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true], [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true], or an [guide|25705|iOpener|new_window=true] to heat the back glass perimeter until it's slightly too hot to touch.
The heat softens the adhesive and helps create a better bond.


## Apply pressure to the perimeter
Use your fingers to firmly squeeze around the perimeter of the iPhone.


## Step 2
Place your iPhone screen-side down on a clean, flat work surface.
Lay a strip of tape around the perimeter of the back glass to protect the finish.
Stack coins around the perimeter of the back glass until you create a wall that's as tall as the rear camera protrusions.
Alternatively, you can use [guide|142291|vise clamps] around the perimeter of your device to set the new adhesive.


## Step 3
Place 3-4 heavy books squarely on top of your iPhone.
The coins may leave a slight impression on the bottom book cover, so don't use anything valuable.
Leave the books in place for about 30 minutes.
The pressure will help activate the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Taptic_Engine_Replacement,266

## Step 5
Heat the bonding pad with Hot Air Gun at 280℃ to remove the black adhesive.
Dip rosin with Soldering Iron and Solder Wick to remove tin on the bonding pad.
Clean the bonding pad with PCB Cleaner afterward.


## Step 6
Apply some Paste Flux to the bonding pad and put an iPhone 12 256G NAND in position.

Set up the phone and WiFi can be searched normally.
Go to Settings > About. The phone has a 256G capacity.
The serial number, WiFi address, and Bluetooth address remain unchanged.
It can be confirmed that the serial number, WiFi address, and Bluetooth address are no longer stored on the NAND. REWA technicians speculate that the serial number, WiFi address, and Bluetooth address are likely stored on EPROM or CPU. The technological change that Apple has made does make storage upgrade easier. But REWA doesn't recommend that users upgrade storage on their own. The first reason is that Apple does not provide a warranty for the phone that has been disassembled before. The second reason is that inappropriate operation may lead to some malfunctions. The water resistance function will be much worse. But for a phone with a bad NAND, it will be much easier to repair.",Upgrade_iPhone_12_64GB_Storage_to_256GB,195

[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baHX1yrDKbY&t=248s]

It is well known that Apple has added MagSafe to the iPhone 12 series. While trying to separate the back glass, we found that the magnets were glued to the back glass. Undoubtedly, the difficulty to refurbish the iPhone 12 series back glass has accordingly increased. Thanks to our rich experience and proper tools, we finally figured out the right way to fix the iPhone 12 back glass.

# Disassemble the phone and remove the wireless charging coil.
# After that, scan the back glass with laser except for the camera area.
# Then we remove the magnet array and the back glass.
# Put on the new back glass with enlarged camera holes.
# Stick the magnet array and shield to the new back glass.
The foregoing guide gives you a clear and correct guide about how to replace the iPhone 12 back glass.

However, the journey to search the right way was not easy. We made the first attempt and almost failed. Scroll down and you will see what challenges we have come across.

iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_1,"## Laser Marking
Put the back glass of iPhone 12 under the focus positioning probe of the laser marking machine. After positioning, mark the back glass area except for the camera and wireless charging area. We haven't marked the wireless charging area to avoid damage.


## Back Glass Separation
A new member, Glass Breaking Pen, is coming to our back glass refurbishing tools family. Break the back glass with Glass Breaking Pen and remove the shards with Pry Bar.
When breaking the wireless charging area, you can see that the magnets are glued to the glass. Hence the back glass fix solution of iPhone 11 is not suitable for iPhone 12.
If we stick to our old method, all magnets will fall off and become separate. The subsequent recovering process will be harder. In addition, we can’t mark the wireless charging area directly with a laser to avoid damage.


## Back Glass Separation
We should remove the wireless charging coil and then mark. The magnet array and shield can be easily removed after marking.


## Back Glass Separation
Then we remove the glass around the camera. Please do not touch the camera lens.
After the glass is completely removed, mark the back again to remove residual adhesive.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,245
iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_2,"## Back Glass Separation
Then we remove the glass around the camera. Please do not touch the camera lens.
After the glass is completely removed, mark the back again to remove residual adhesive.


## Back Glass Gluing
Clamp a new back glass with enlarged camera holes down to the middle frame first to see if it fits.
Apply some adhesive evenly on the middle frame. Put the back glass in position and press it gently against the middle frame.


## Back Glass Gluing
Press the back glass further against the middle frame with Press Clamp.
The adhesive has set after 10 minutes. Take the back cover out. Check if the gap is too large, if there is adhesive overflow, and if the fit is smooth.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,154
iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement_3,"## Back Glass Gluing
After the back glass gluing is finished, we install the magnet array and shield. Apply some B-7000 Adhesive on the magnet circle to adhere the magnet array to the back.
Please make sure that the opening of the magnet array is placed in the right position as in the picture.
Stick the magnet that we accidentally cut out back on and glue the alignment magnet.
Last but not least, assemble the phone and test the MagSafe function. The MagSafe function is normal.
In conclusion, MagSafe is added to the iPhone 12 series, which makes it harder to refurbish the back glass. Since the magnets are glued to the back glass, we need to detach the magnets before removing the back glass. Therefore, the iPhone 12 series currently don’t support the back glass separating without disassembling. The wireless charging coil needs to be removed first. Then we can separate the back glass by marking the back glass except for the camera area. The success rate of the foregoing method is higher. But the method can be not only demanding but also has a high requirement for the technician. We will continuously make a painstaking effort to seek the best iPhone 12 back glass refurbishing solution and even the back glass separating without disassembling. Please stay tuned.",iPhone_12_Back_Glass_Replacement,276

[video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCdPuZbPCEM]

The repair rate of the screen is one of the highest among many mobile phone parts. Professional screen refurbishment tools and techniques can not only reduce screen replacement failure rate but also improve repair efficiency. It is well known that all iPhone 12 lineup features an OLED screen. Today REWA LAB will take the iPhone 12 screen refurbishment as an example to introduce the up-to-date screen refurbishment techniques and machines in the industry. Let's take a look!

## Cosmetic Inspection
Firstly, let's run a cosmetic inspection of the screen. We can see that the iPhone 12 has a narrower bezel than the iPhone 11 Pro, so the iPhone 12 bezel may be a little easier to disassemble.
In addition to that, the iPhone 12 bezel doesn’t wrap around the glass lens anymore. Therefore, the material requirements for the bezel adhesive will be relatively high to prevent the adhesive from falling off. To dig deeper, we will refurbish the iPhone 12 screen.",iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment,248
iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment_1,"## Screen Testing
First of all, let’s test the screen. The display, touch, and 3D Touch all function well.
Place the screen upside down on the Screen Separator, set the temperature to 100 ℃, and start the suction.


## Bezel Removing
Remove the ear speaker flex cable first. Since the ear speaker flex cable is very easy to damage, please be noted that we need to heat the screen before removing it.
Besides, the iPhone 12 ear speaker sensor ring is integrated into the bezel.


## Bezel Removing
Now, let’s remove the bezel. Dip adhesive remover on the bezel first.
While using the Razor Blade to separate the bezel, you need to dip some adhesive remover too.
Slide the Razor Blade back and forth, and pry up the bezel carefully.",iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment,173
iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment_2,"## Bezel Removing
As the ear speaker flex cable part has more adhesive, we can dip more adhesive remover to make it loose.
Hold the two corners of the bezel in both hands, and detach the bezel slowly with caution.
Our original thought was to separate the bezel in a complete manner and then reuse it. But now the bezel is broken here. So please notice that this part of the bezel is made of plastic material, which is extremely easy to break. If you want to separate the bezel completely, you need to pay extra attention.


## Bezel Removing
In order not to induce damage, we use a thin film to remove the flex cable part.
Remove the bezel and it can be seen that the 3M adhesive used in the bezel flex cable part is no longer the cold adhesive. The 3M adhesive makes the bezel relatively easy to remove.


## Glass Lens Separating
Remove excess adhesive on the ear speaker flex cable part.
Start separating the OLED along the bottom layer of the glass lens with Cutting Wire.
Through our observation, we found that the touch panel of the iPhone 12 screen is better than that of the iPhone 11 Pro, which is not easy to damage. To put it specifically, the touch panel of the iPhone 12 is thicker and the cut lines are clearer and wider.",iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment,280
iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment_3,"## OCA Adhesive Removing
Place the OLED on the heating platform.
Roll up the OCA adhesive with the Electric Adhesive Removing Tool and remove the remaining OCA adhesive with a hand.


## OCA Adhesive Removing
Connect the OLED and ear speaker flex cable. The display and touch function works well.
A point worth mentioning is that not connecting the ear speaker flex cable will lead to the absence of light-sensing. The screen will be too dark to be tested.


## Laminating
Attach the OCA adhesive to the glass lens.
Put the glass lens with OCA adhesive into the Bubble Removing Machine for 3 minutes.
Then put it into the UV Lamp for Curing OCA Glue for 5 seconds.


## Laminating
Wipe clean the OLED and use the pull tape to stick a corner of the glass lens.
Press the pull tape for seconds and then tear off the protective film of the OCA adhesive.


## Laminating
Since the iPhone 12 aligning mold has not come out yet, we use manual alignment.
After alignment, place the screen on the laminating sponge.
Please notice that two slots are cut on the sponge in order to prevent OLED damage.",iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment,247
iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment_4,"## Laminating
Put the screen into the laminating machine and press “LCD laminate start”.
Take out the screen and we can see there are bubbles on the screen.


## Laminating
Put the screen back into the Bubble Removing Machine for 10 minutes and then put the screen into the UV Lamp for Curing OCA Glue for 180 seconds.
Assemble the refurbished screen on the phone and all functions work well.
To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",iPhone_12_Screen_Refurbishment,100

## Step 1
Apple has encrypted the battery of iPhone XS and models above. Once you replace the battery, you will get the “Important Battery Message” and “Service” message. To make matters worse, the cycle count of the new battery will show the cycle count of the original battery.
Especially the battery data of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series still can’t be accessed. It has been verified by technicians that the “Important Battery Message” will show up after you put in an aftermarket battery or a genuine Apple battery.
You can only avoid the problem by letting Apple Stores or Apple Authorized Service Providers replace your battery.


## Step 2
To solve the problem, the latest solution has been verified. Today we will share solutions concerning iPhone XS series, iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series.
First of all, we will introduce the structure of the battery. The battery can be roughly divided into two parts – BMS board and battery cell. The battery management system board mainly serves as a protection board but also saves battery data. The battery cell is where the power is stored.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,285
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_1,"## Step 3
Taking iPhone XS for example, we need to prepare a battery data corrector and a new battery cell that can be an original one or an aftermarket one. Disassemble the phone and remove the battery.
Then we need to Spot Weld the BMS board of the original battery to the new battery cell. Remove the protective tape on the BMS board. Please do not break the flex cable.
Disconnect the cathode and anode of the battery with a pair of scissors.


## Step 4
Remove the original battery BMS board. Please align the anode and cathode respectively.
Solder with the Spot Welder.
After soldering, install the BMS board. Apply the protection tape.


## Step 5
Since the BMS board is replaced and the battery is protected, the voltage can’t be measured. We need to activate the battery with a Direct Current Supply.
Connect the battery to the programmer. Click reading. Battery data on the BMS board can be seen.


## Step 6
Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Then we connect the display to the motherboard. Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,254
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_2,"## Step 6
Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Then we connect the display to the motherboard. Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.


## Step 7
Please be noted that you can only turn on the phone by a power cable. The above step takes advantage of bugs in iOS and is a very important step. Then we install the new battery. Go to “Settings” to view the battery health information. The maximum capacity is 100% and there is no “Important Battery Message”.
Different from iPhone XS series, the battery data of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series is encrypted and cannot be accessed. That is to say, even if you replace with the original battery cell, the battery data still can’t be read. Worse still, you can’t correct the battery health and cycle count.
Recently, we have got the latest battery data corrector on the market. Through verification, the corrector can effectively remove the “Important Battery Message” of iPhone 11 series and iPhone 12 series. Next, we will share the operation process in detail by an iPhone 11 Pro.
Remove the BMS board of the original battery. Solder the BMS board to the new battery cell.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,260
iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed_3,"## Step 8
Install the BMS board. Activate the battery with a Direct Current Supply.
Because the data of iPhone 11 series can’t be directly read, we need a specialized PCB board to read the data. Install the PCB board to the battery.


## Step 9
Then connect the battery to the programmer. Click reading. Recalibrate the cycle times and battery efficiency.
Connect the power cable to turn on the phone. “Important Battery Message” is displayed.
Then we install the new battery. Go to “Settings” to view the battery health information. The maximum capacity is 100% and there is no “Important Battery Message”.
To reassemble your device, follow these instructions in reverse order.",iPhone_XS_-12_Pro_Max_Important_Battery_Message_Pop-ups_Removing_-_100%_Fixed,148

## Step 1
Press the power button and the phone won’t turn on. Connect the phone to power and the phone still won’t turn on.
Disconnect the display. Power up the motherboard. Please be noted that the time for powering up shouldn’t be too long. It can be seen that the current value is large. The motherboard has a large current which indicates the motherboard is short-circuited.
Next, we need to remove the motherboard and locate the faulty part for repair. Measure the diode value of PP_BATT_VCC line with a multimeter.The diode value is 0. It can be confirmed that PP_BATT_VCC line is short-circuited.
PP_BATT_VCC line and PP_VDD_MAIN line of iPhone 12 are connected in series by an inductor. So the short-circuited PP_BATT_VCC line may also cause the PP_VDD_MAIN line to short circuit.",Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera,271
Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera_1,"## Step 2
The old solution to repair the large current problem is through rosin detecting. Through the melting of rosin, we can confirm the faulty part. Though the solution is cheap and effective, it has some shortcomings. The motherboard has to be covered with rosin while the rosin is hard to clean up afterward.
In addition, we have to remove shielding covers on the motherboard for a thorough inspection. There is no doubt that operation difficulty will be greatly enhanced.
Today we will introduce a more advanced and effective way to look for short circuit on the motherboard with the help of a  Thermal Imager Camera . The thermal imager locates the part of which temperature is higher than normal value via infrared radiation.
The thermal imager can detect motherboard electric leakage within seconds. The faulty parts will be detected in no time once you put the motherboard under the camera, tremendously improving repair efficiency. While checking overall motherboard working conditions, the thermal imager can pinpoint faulty parts with high accuracy.
Furthermore, the thermal imager is an expert in detecting small electric leakage, short circuit and other problems with easy and safe operation, substantially lowering the error rate.",Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera,243
Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera_2,"## Step 3
First of all, we put the motherboard on the working platform. Connect the black probe of the direct power supply to the ground and connect the red probe to PP_BATT_VCC line. The temperature on the top left corner has risen up. The faulty part can be confirmed on the top left corner.
Open the bitmap. We can see that PP_BATT_VCC line is not on the top left corner. Since PP_BATT_VCC line and PP_VDD_MAIN line are connected in series by an inductor, we can judge that PP_VDD_MAIN line is short-circuited.
Through inductors of PP_BATT_VCC line, click another side of the inductors. The other side is connected to PP_VDD_MAIN line. We can again determine the range of faulty part.
It can be seen on the bitmap that the PP_VDD_MAIN line is on the logic board.


## Step 4
Next, we separate the motherboard. Put the motherboard on the 170 °C  Heating Platform to heat.
After the logic board has cooled, power up the logic board. Connect the black probe to the ground and connect the red probe to PP_VDD_MAIN line. Through the thermal image, we can now confirm the faulty part. The capacitor is flawed with charring.",Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera,293
Fix_iPhone_12_Won't_Turn_On_By_Infrared_Thermal_Imaging_Camera_3,"## Step 5
Remove the capacitor and clean the bonding pad with PCB Cleaner. Measure the diode values of PP_VDD_MAIN line and PP_BATT_VCC line. The diode values return to normal. The short circuit fault has been eliminated.


## Step 6
Then we recombine the motherboard. Assemble the phone to test. The phone turns on normally. WiFi and baseband function well. IMEI number can be seen. The fault has been eliminated.

'''Caution:''' Before you begin, discharge your iPhone battery below 25%. A charged lithium-ion battery can catch fire and/or explode if accidentally punctured.
Power off your iPhone before beginning disassembly.
Remove the two 6.75 mm long pentalobe P2 screws at the bottom edge of the iPhone.
Opening the iPhone's display will compromise its waterproof seals. Have replacement seals ready before you proceed past this step, or take care to avoid liquid exposure if you reassemble your iPhone without replacing the seals.

The iPhone 14 was announced on September 7th, 2022 alongside its brothers and sisters the Plus, Pro and Pro Max. Released on September 16th, it features the A15 Bionic chip but with a 5-core GPU. [br]

While the international model accepts both a physical SIM card and eSIM, the US version got away with the SIM card reader and only supports eSIM (dual e-SIM). The new feature [link|https://support.apple.com/de-de/HT213426|Emergency SOS via satellite] is only available in the US and Canada.

However, after receiving extensive feedback from the repair community, iFixit [link|https://www.ifixit.com/News/82493/we-are-retroactively-dropping-the-iphones-repairability-score-en|downrated the score to 4/10|new_window=true] in September 2023.

== Identification ==

You can identify the iPhone 14 by the one of the following [link|https://#Models|model numbers] printed on the inside back of the Lightning (charge) port. Flip the iPhone over (with the screen facing away from you) to see it.

You can also find the model number through the phone's UI by going to the ***Settings*** app and navigating to ***General*** > ***About***. Tap on the number listed in the ***Model Number*** section and it should change to a format that looks like the numbers above.

The iPhone 14 features a 6.1 in (diagonal) flat glass screen, thin black bezels, and a notch at the top of the screen to accommodate a speaker and selfie camera. The back cover is glass and the edge frame is made from flat anodized aluminum.

Volume controls can be found on the left edge while the power button is situated on the right. A rectangular camera ""bump"" containing two diagonally-aligned cameras protrudes slightly from the back case. This model has no home button.

The iPhone 14 can be differentiated from the iPhone 13 by the lack of a SIM tray (for US models only).

Use this guide to replace a worn-out or dead battery in your iPhone 14.

iPhone batteries are rated to hold 80% of their capacity for up to 500 charge cycles, which lasts roughly 18-24 months for most users. After that, your iPhone may need to be charged far more frequently, and iOS may warn you that performance is affected (in other words, your phone will run slower).

This guide was created using the ***A2882*** (international) model. If you're fixing a different iPhone 14 model, there may be some visual discrepancies, but the procedure should be the same.

Each adhesive strip has a black pull-tab at the end, which is lightly adhered to the edge of the battery.
In the following steps, you'll pull each tab to slowly stretch out the adhesive underneath the battery. These ""command-strip"" style adhesives lose their stick when stretched, so you can remove the battery with ease.
If the strips break, don't panic! They don't always work as intended. Keep reading for tips on removing broken strips.",iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement,278
iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement_11,"## Remove the stretch-release adhesive
***Caution:*** Don't jab the battery with any sharp tools. A punctured battery may leak dangerous chemicals or catch fire.
Use a pair of blunt-nosed [product|IF145-020|tweezers] to peel up the two battery adhesive pull-tabs along the top edge of the battery.


## Step 3
Grab the first pull-tab with your fingers or wrap it around a spudger and ''slowly'' pull it away from the battery, toward the top of the iPhone.
Pull out hard enough to maintain tension on the strip, but don't force it. Give it plenty of time to stretch and un-stick from under the battery.
Don't press down on the battery but hold the iPhone firmly by its sides.
Keep the strip flat and unwrinkled. Try to pull evenly on the whole strip, rather than pulling mainly in the middle or on one side.
If the adhesive strip breaks off, try to retrieve it using your fingers or blunt tweezers, and continue pulling—but '''do not''' pry under the battery.
If any of the adhesive strips break off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, try to remove the other strip, and then proceed as instructed below.",iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement,280
iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement_12,"## Step 4
Grab the second pull-tab with your fingers or the center of a spudger and pull it away from the battery, toward the top of the iPhone.
Follow the same procedure as with the previous strip: don't press down on the battery, keep the strip flat and unwrinkled, and pull at a low angle.
If the adhesive strip breaks off, try to retrieve it using your fingers or blunt tweezers, and continue pulling—but ***do not*** pry under the battery.
If the adhesive breaks off underneath the battery and can't be retrieved, continue with the next step.


## How to remove a stuck battery
If you're still having trouble removing the battery, apply a few drops of high concentration (90% or higher) isopropyl alcohol under the edge of the battery in the area of the broken adhesive strip(s).
Wait about one minute for the alcohol solution to weaken the adhesive.
Use an opening pick or the flat end of a spudger to gently lift the battery.
Don't try to forcefully lever the battery out. If needed, apply a few more drops of alcohol to further weaken the adhesive. Never deform or puncture the battery with your pry tool.",iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement,266
iPhone_14_Battery_Replacement_13,"## Remove the battery
Remove the battery.
Do not reinstall a damaged or deformed battery, as doing so is a potential safety hazard.
If there's any alcohol solution remaining in the phone, carefully wipe it off before installing your new battery.
If your new battery didn't come with adhesive preinstalled, refer to [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Battery+Adhesive+Strips+Replacement+for+iPhone+8+8+Plus+XR+SE+2020/103936|this guide|new_window=true] for help replacing the adhesive strips.

If your iPhone has a cracked rear glass, keep further breakage contained and prevent bodily harm during your repair by taping over the glass.
Lay overlapping strips of clear packing tape over the iPhone's rear glass until the whole face is covered.
Wear safety glasses to protect your eyes from any glass shaken free during the repair.
If you can't get the suction cup to stick in the next few steps, fold a strong piece of tape (such as duct tape) into a handle and lift the rear glass with that instead.
If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the rear glass.


## Heat the bottom edge
Use a [guide|157348|hair dryer|new_window=true] or a [guide|151116|heat gun|new_window=true] to heat the bottom edge of the iPhone for 90 seconds or until the rear glass is slightly too hot to touch.

Apply a suction handle to the bottom edge of the rear glass, while avoiding the very edge of the glass.
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the rear glass and the case.
Insert an opening pick into the gap.
The adhesive holding the rear glass in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force. If you're having a hard time opening a gap, apply more heat, and gently rock the rear glass up and down to weaken the adhesive until you create enough of a gap to insert your opening pick.


## Heat the left edge
Use a hair dryer to heat the left edge of the iPhone for 90 seconds or until the rear glass is slightly too hot to touch.


## Slice the left edge adhesive
Slide the opening pick around the lower left corner and up the left edge of the iPhone, slicing through the adhesive holding the rear glass in place.

## Cleaning and preparation
Start by removing any adhesive and pieces of glass from your iPhone frame.
The adhesive is very sticky so the method that worked for me best was using a razor and a pair of tweezers.
Take your time with this. All remaining glass and adhesive left will increase the chance of the backglass breaking again.


## Flash clip removal
Unscrew the Y000 screw holding the flash clip into place.
Lift the clip up and store it somewhere safe along with the screws and other parts.",iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement,250
iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement_9,"## Flash clip removal
Unscrew the Y000 screw holding the flash clip into place.
Lift the clip up and store it somewhere safe along with the screws and other parts.


## Microphone clip removal
Remove the clip keeping the microphone in place.
To do so use a pair of tweezers and slide them under the openings to the side. Just be careful doing so.
When done you can see the small cushion between the clip and microphone.


## Microphone grill transfer
You will have to move the microphone grill across to the new backcover before moving on. I had to use heaps of hot air and pry it from the old backcover.
Make sure you get the clip holder and the cylindrical grill.
You will need some adhesive to glue them back to the new cover. Apply enough the make it stick.


## Lift up ribbon cables
Use a hair dryer or a heat gun to apply heat to the backcover.
Lift up the ribbon cables carefully with a spudger or flat tweezers as shown in the image.
The flash can be pushed inwards from the back when the holding clip has been removed.",iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement,235
iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement_10,"## Remove charging coil
Use heat from the back and directly to the charging coil to loosen the adhesive of the charging coil.
You can use a razor blade to lift up the adhesive flaps on the side. When you are really careful you should be able to do so without damage.
Apply heat to the coil again and you may insert flat tweezers between backcover and the coil. It is probably safer to insert it from the ***bottom*** part!


## Inspect charging coil and magnets
Inspect the coil to make sure there is no damage to the copper and connections.
If your new backcover lacks the magnets you have to move them across from old to new in order to move on!


## Transfer to new backcover
Place the old assembly on the new backcover and align everything carefully. You probably won't need new adhesive as the old one is probably still strong enough.
Place the flash and microphone back into place, screw down the flash clip and add the clip for the microphone.",iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement,214
iPhone_14_charging_coil_assembly_replacement_11,"## First test
It is always recommended to test anything before resealing the backcover. Rest the new backglass against an object and reseat the coil and then the battery connector.
Close the backcover and start up your iPhone. Mine fortunately worked right away.
Test the video camera with sound as well as the wireless charging capabilities. If anything seems to be off you can inspect everything again before finalizing this repair.


## Camera glass inspection and glue
As you can see the camera glass is protected with a red film from the inside. Do not use hard objects to remove it as you could scratch the glass.
Use cotton swabs or something similar to clean your camera lenses as well as the camera glass. If you forget this step your photos and videos might look off.
Reapply glue to the frame again before closing everything down. My battery came with an adhesive gasket that I used.


## Finish
With everything nice and clean and glue or a gasket added you may reconnect the coil and battery in this order and close the backcover.
Start up your iPhone and test everything again to make sure the repair is successful.
Screw the two P2 pentalobe screws back to the bottom of your iPhone. You're done!

MacBook_Pro_0,"MacBook Pro
Apple's line of laptops for professional and power users. To date, the MacBook Pro line includes 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17-inch variants, with major revisions defined by Pre-unibody(Original), unibody, Retina display, Touch Bar, and SOC (system-on-a-chip) designs.
== Background ==

The MacBook Pro laptop was first introduced in January 2006; it replaced the PowerBook G4, Apple's earlier professional line of laptops. The original MacBook Pro model came in an aluminum enclosure, a trend that continues with this line of laptops today.

After more than two years and numerous incremental upgrades, Apple announced a completely new MacBook Pro model in October 2008, dubbed the MacBook Pro 15"" Unibody. The MacBook 15"" Unibody is a distinct update of the original MacBook Pro, packing all the previous features of the Pro into a more stylish and lighter weight aluminum enclosure.",MacBook_Pro,217
MacBook_Pro_1,"In late 2012 Apple introduced the thinner and lighter MacBook Pro with Retina Display, bringing crisp high-resolution screens, but vastly reduced serviceability—Retina models’ lifespan is artificially limited by things like glued-down batteries and soldered RAM. Later models took this trend further by soldering down the storage, making these “pro” machines effectively non-serviceable and non-upgradeable after purchase.

2016 brought the most radically different and polarizing generation of MacBook Pros yet, with all I/O ports replaced by a small number of USB-C (Thunderbolt) ports. The popular and practical MagSafe charging port was also eliminated. Function keys were replaced by the Touch Bar, a touch-sensitive OLED strip that dynamically displays various context-dependent controls. Apple also completely re-engineered the keyboard, replacing its conventional scissor switches with extremely low-travel “butterfly” switches, which allowed for a thinner device and more stable key presses—but the mechanism proved relatively fragile and unreliable even after several revisions to the hardware, and reactions to the “feel” of the low-travel keys were mixed even when they worked correctly. The problem was compounded by the lack of practical repair options; fixing the keyboard requires replacing the device’s entire top case assembly, including the battery and speakers. Apple eventually created a 4-year extended warranty program for the troubled keyboard.",MacBook_Pro,286

Please keep in mind that correctly cleaning your logic board after a liquid spill may NOT solve your issue, even one failed capacitor or broken solder joint can be the end of the road for the average DIYer.

However in some cases this process will pave the way for a complete MacBook restoration.


###Tools Required:

 - Ultra Sonic Cleaner

 - Pro Tech Toolkit

 - Isopropyl Alcohol


###Parts Required:

## Remove your MacBooks Main Logic Board
Your first step is to remove your MacBooks main Logic Board, this process will very from model to model and the guides are readily available on iFixit. For this example we will be disassembling an A1502 MacBook Pro w/ Force Touch.


## Remove the heat sink and thermal paste.
Next, we are going to remove the heat sink and thermal paste.  Again this step will very slightly from model to model but is important to ensure proper cleaning.


## Clean the obvious corrosion.
Place the MLB on a lint free towel and begin to carefully remove any visible corrosion with a tooth brush and  99% Isopropyl alcohol. AT this point I would take pictures of the affected areas before cleaning so you have an idea of where to start diagnostics once the board has been cleaned.",How_to_Correctly_clean_corrosion_from_a_MacBook_Pro_logic_board.,280
How_to_Correctly_clean_corrosion_from_a_MacBook_Pro_logic_board._1,"## Ultrasonic bath - NOT OPTIONAL - Turn your volume down
Placing the board in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes at 40c with some type of electronics safe detergent will ensure that corrosion that is not visible to the naked eye will be removed.  Electricity is the catalyst for corrosion, even a small amount left untreated can come back to bite you.  In my opinion a toothbrush and alcohol alone is risky.


## Rinse and allow to dry.
Place the logic board in a shallow bath of 99% alcohol for a few minutes to displace the water from the ultrasonic bath. Use canned air or and electric air gun to blow the board dry.


## Inspection, Inspection and more Inspection.
If you have  a stereo microscope you should go over the board to look for damaged components or broken solder joints.  If no microscope is available this would be a good time to loosely reassemble the unit and see if you have a good result.  If the unit has visible issues board level you may want to consider finding a professional  repair option.


## Test and keep testing until you get the result you want.
Like we said in the beginning, getting the MLB up and running is likely one of several steps required to restore a MacBook after a liquid spill. We hope this guide was helpful, Good Luck.

 - T6 Torx Screwdriver

 - Small Phillips Head Screwdriver

 - Spudger

 - Scissors


###Parts Required:

 - Thermal Pad (2mm thick)


## Dissassembly
First off you'll need to locate a disassembly guide for your machine and follow it carefully to remove the logic board.
If you haven't already, this would be a good opportunity to follow a guide for replacing the thermal paste.",How_to_Reduce_MacBook_Pro_Core_Temperature,195
How_to_Reduce_MacBook_Pro_Core_Temperature_1,"## Thermally bonding the heatsinks
The aim here is to sandwich thick thermal pads under you MacBook's heatsinks to contact the upper case, and atop them to contact the bottom cover.  This will help conduct heat away from the machine by effectively making the entire unibody one big heatsink.
On my machine, a mid-2010 15 inch MBP, I needed to use three strips of a 2mm thick thermal pad under the centre heatsink, two strips under the side one and one strip atop each to make contact with the bottom cover.
Try to use enough layers that the heatsinks are in good contact, but not so many that anything needs to bend to fit back.

 - Tweezers

 - Adhesive Cleanup Kit


###Parts Required:

 - MacBook Pro Retina (A1425, A1502, A1398, and A2289) Plastic Feet


## Step 1
Peel away any stickers from the backside of the rear case covering the feet you have chosen to replace.
Any stickers you remove will most likely be unsalvageable for re-use. That's okay! Your MacBook does not need them to function.


## Step 2
Remove any broken or damaged feet.
If the foot you are replacing is still intact, you can use your [product|IF145-020|tweezers]  push it out from the inside.
If the old foot is difficult to remove, use a hair dryer or a heat gun to apply some heat to the area and loosen the adhesive.


## Step 3
Scrub the foot cavity with adhesive remover to remove any remaining adhesive.",MacBook_Pro_Retina_2012–2015_Feet_Replacement,281
MacBook_Pro_Retina_2012–2015_Feet_Replacement_1,"## Step 3
Scrub the foot cavity with adhesive remover to remove any remaining adhesive.


## Step 4
Wipe the foot cavity with an isopropyl alcohol prep pad to remove any cleaner residue and prep the area for the adhesive on the new foot.


## Step 5
Peel a replacement foot from the plastic backing.
The adhesive is fairly strong—make sure that you are peeling the foot up, not tearing the plastic backing.


## Step 6
Align the new foot inside the cavity.
Make sure the alignment nub on the foot is lined up with the small hole near the perimeter of the pad.
You may want to use a pencil to lightly mark where the alignment nub is located. Be careful not to scratch the lower case with your pencil.
Lay the foot down while keeping it properly aligned.
Check for proper alignment from the inside of the case. The alignment nub should be slightly visible through the alignment hole.


## Step 7
Press the new foot into place firmly with your finger, then apply pressure by pinching the foot from either side of the case with your finger and your thumb.
Maintain pressure for 30 seconds to set the pressure-sensitive adhesive.
Repeat the last seven steps for any remaining broken or worn feet.

Repair information and guides for MacBook Pro models with 13"" displays.
== Background and Identification ==

Apple's first 13"" MacBook Pro was an aluminum unibody laptop released in mid 2009. Previously, Apple had only offered the Pro model in 15 and 17 inch varieties starting in 2006, but decided to upgrade and rebrand the white, polycarbonate 13 inch MacBook to offer a smaller model in the Pro lineup. This new MacBook Pro would also feature an aluminum unibody, and would move from the previous user-removable battery design to one that was located underneath the bottom case. Along with these changes, they also included an SD card slot, Firewire 800 port, and improved screen.

In 2012, Apple made the first significant change to the design of the 13” MacBook Pro with the release of Retina Display. This new Retina Display MacBook Pro featured a thinner body, a higher resolution screen with a thinner bezel, and an HDMI port. Other changes include a thinner MagSafe charging connector (dubbed MagSafe 2) that is incompatible with previous charging cables, soldered and therefore non-upgradable memory, and a glued down battery. The thinner chassis also prevented this design from including an optical drive.","MacBook_Pro_13""",266
"MacBook_Pro_13""_1","In 2016, the Touch Bar model was released, which namely featured a thin OLED screen with multi-touch capabilities at the top of the keyboard in place of the function keys. This model was the first to include the infamous “butterfly keyboard” which has had several issues, some of which have been [link|https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks|formally acknowledged by Apple]. This model marked Apple’s transition from USB Type A to USB-C, as these laptops included only USB-C ports, relying on dongles to supply the user with any ports they may need. This included the MagSafe charging standard, as the laptops would be able to charge from any of their USB-C ports. Other notable changes include the inclusion of a fingerprint scanner, soldered flash storage in addition to the memory, a stickier adhesive holding the battery to the case, and a significantly larger trackpad.

## Step 1
Press the power button. The MacBook won’t turn on.
Plug in the BY-3200 power cable and the input voltage is 20V.
The current reading on the DC Power Supply stays at 0.047A.


## Step 2
Unplug the power cable. Next, we need to disassemble the MacBook and test.
The MacBook model is A1989.
Remove the screws and disconnect the battery connector flex cable.


## Step 3
Plug in the BY-3200 and the input voltage is 5V.
The current reading on the DC Power Supply stays at 0.059A.
The power supply of the motherboard is only 5V, which is abnormal.
The normal power supply should be 20V. It indicates that the motherboard has malfunctioned.


## Step 4
Then we remove the motherboard and install the power connector flex cable.",Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On,252
Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On_1,"## Step 4
Then we remove the motherboard and install the power connector flex cable.


## Step 5
The motherboard number is 820-00850-07.
Open the schematic diagram and bitmap.
U3900 is the T2 chip. U7800 is the power chip.


## Step 6
Measure the standby voltage of the T2 chip, which is supplied by the U7800. Find U7800 on the schematic diagram.
This table shows the standby voltage of T2 chip.


## Step 7
Pug in the power cable.
The motherboard current stops at 0.06A and the input voltage is only 5V.


## Step 8
Measure the power supply of the motherboard.
The measured voltage values are normal. It can be judged that the power supply circuit of the motherboard is good.
Next, we need to decide if the fault (voltage failing to increase) is caused by T2 chip data problems.


## Step 9
Find T2 chip on the bitmap and the location name is U3900. Search U3900 on the diagram and find the ROM chip for T2.
Copy signal SPI_SOCROM_MISO. Find SoC ROM and the location name is U4770. Find U4770 on bitmap.",Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On,275
Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On_2,"## Step 10
Find SoC ROM (U4770) on the motherboard. Remove SoC ROM chip with Hot Air Gun at 430℃.
Get the BY-T200 and write the new SoC ROM data. Attach the chip to the seat of BY-T200. Pin 1 of the chip must align with the red dot on the tool.
Then connect BY-T200 with the computer.


## Step 11
Install the driver and open AsProgrammer.


## Step 12
Click Read ID and select MX25U3235F_1.8V.


## Step 13
Click Open file and select A1989 T2 ROM original data.bin.


## Step 14
Click Auto Program and click Yes.
Data writing has completed.


## Step 15
Unplug BY-T200. Solder the chip back to the motherboard.
Plug in the power cable. The BY-3200 shows an increase in input voltage from 5V to 20V.
The current jump on the DC power supply is normal, which indicates that the motherboard is turned on.


## Step 16
Disconnect the power cable and install the motherboard. Plug in the power cable.
The MacBook is turned on and can enter the system.",Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On,254
Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On_3,"## Step 16
Disconnect the power cable and install the motherboard. Plug in the power cable.
The MacBook is turned on and can enter the system.


## Step 17
Lastly, assemeble the MacBook.
Connect the battery flex cable and put the back cover on.
Plug in the power cable and press the power button. The MacBook is turned on and can enter the system. The fault has been cleared.
In the first place, we used MacBook BY-3200 power cable to observe the change of boot voltage and current. The voltage values related to the boot circuit on the motherboard were found to be normal after measuring. To determine whether the fault was caused by data problems, BY-T200 Data Assistant was used to read and write the data of T2 chip ROM. After rewriting the ROM data of T2 chip, the MacBook could turn on and enter the system. The no power fault has been cleared.",Repair_For_MacBook_Pro_A1989_That_Won't_Turn_On,196

I recently cracked the bezel of my 2017 13” Macbook Pro. The screen was perfectly fine and the bezel is purely cosmetic but Apple said they had to replace the whole screen for $600 to replace the bezel, but I did it for less than $20.

You can purchase replacement bezels easily by simply searching the year and bezel (e.g. “Macbook Pro 13” 2017 Bezel”). I have linked the bezel that I purchased from eBay in the parts list.

The only difficult part of this repair is removing the existing bezel.

 - Isopropyl Alcohol 70%

 - Compressed Air

Always power down your device before attempting any repair.
This is the only stressful part of the repair but is surprisingly easier than it seems.
You need to remove the existing cracked bezel. Use a hairdryer to carefully loosen the adhesive.
NOTE: The adhesive is a 4mm strip of double-sided tape and it is only on the top side of the bezel. Be extra careful if you are using a hairdryer or heatgun.
You may not need to use heat to loosen the adhesive, I simply used [product|IF145-020|tweezers] to pick off bits of glass and was able to slowly take one side off. Then simply running my nail down the other half, the whole bezel came off in one go.


## Remove Any Left Over Adhesive/Glass
Use isopropyl alcohol to remove any leftover adhesive.
Make sure there aren't any tiny shards of glass in the small gaps. I recommend using a can of compressed air to remove the shards.",13”_&_15”_Retina_MacBook_Pro_Glass_Bezel_Replacement,220
13”_&_15”_Retina_MacBook_Pro_Glass_Bezel_Replacement_2,"## Apply The New Bezel
Simply attach the bezel onto your Macbook and use the rubber seal that surrounds the screen to align the bezel.
Depending on where you purchased your replacement bezel from, you may not have double-sided tape pre-applied. If not, put a strip of double-sided tape on the top edge of the bezel.
The double-sided tape that Apple uses  on the bezel is 4mm. I'm not 100% sure but this could make sure the tape doesn't stick to the delicate ribbon cables.

''Mac in images was an Early 2015 13” Macbook pro but this guide may help other model owners.''

On investigating the issue on my mac I discovered the issue was due to a poorly soldered pin on the headphone jack whose solder joint was already pretty poor and had become disconnected over time. This meant that more often than not, it was triggering the optical out red light and preventing sound from my internal speakers.

This guide is for anyone for who has tried inserting something into their headphone port but this is not working or not fixing the audio consistently. As such this guide is for people who have ruled out debris in the headphone jack or a faulty sensor down the jack hole.

Wear a grounding band or at least ground yourself before proceeding.
Apply gentle pressure to the 2 areas marked in blue with your finger.
This pressure slightly flexes the area and may cause poorly soldered pins to re contact.

How to clean off the faded Anti-Glare coating on your MacBook retina display.


###Tools Required:

 - cloth cleaning towel

 - Masking Tape

 - Regular Plastic Bag

 - Listerine or 99% Isopropyl Alcohol


###Parts Required:

 - None


## Step 1
In this guide you will see a method to completely clean off the faded anti-glare coating on a MacBook retina display.


## Step 2
The 1st step is to cover up the keyboard in case of any accidental spillages. Use tape to seal off and secure the covering (In this case a plastic bag covering) just to be on the safe side.


## Step 3
Next, use some masking tape to cover the rubber around the display edges. This can be quite tricky as we want to aim for 1-2mm inside of the rubber but not sticking it to the rubber to much as when removing it it may damage the fragile rubber. This will help to prevent any solvent harming the gasket and to protect when rubbing the screen clean..",MacBook_Pro_Retina_Display_Anti-Glare_Coating_Clean_Up_Technique,230
MacBook_Pro_Retina_Display_Anti-Glare_Coating_Clean_Up_Technique_1,"## Step 4
Once we are satisfied that everything is protected we can proceed to spreading a thin layer of 99% Isopropyl alcohol OR Mouthwash (Listerine blue color is a good choice). Alcohol will evaporate very quickly, Listerine (Blue color) is the preferred choice as it will last longer & has a cleaning agent that gets into the affected area better.
With your finger gently spread the substance over the affected area and let it go to work for a minute or two.... in this case I have used the Listerine mouthwash.


## Step 5
Now, using a SOFT cloth (NOT Tissues) start gently rubbing away at the affected areas, you'll hopefully notice that the smears are starting to disappear, and the screen is going back to normal.
Take EXTRA CARE NOT TO RUB AT THE EDGES WHERE THE RUBBER GASKET IS. We will come to that later.
You may have to repeat these steps a few times to achieve maximum results, but once satisfied with the vast majority of the screen being cleaned up and is looking nice and clear we can move onto the edges.",MacBook_Pro_Retina_Display_Anti-Glare_Coating_Clean_Up_Technique,229
MacBook_Pro_Retina_Display_Anti-Glare_Coating_Clean_Up_Technique_2,"## Step 6
You can now remove the masking tape and we will gently use some cotton ear buds or your finger inside a soft cloth with some mouthwash to rub more precisely around the edges until all of the gunk has been completely removed. Avoid as much as possible touching the rubber gasket as it can be flaky from age as it can very easily get damaged.


## Step 7
Once we are satisfied with the outcome and the screen is looking almost new again, we can use some screen cleaner and a soft cloth to polish up the screen bringing it truly back to life. A tip is to mask again the rubber gasket as not to rub it off or damage it!
Try to avoid using tissues as their fibers can leave hairline scratches, something we definitely want to avoid happening.


## Step 8
Finally, remove the masking tape going around the edges of the screen and the covering that we have put over the keyboard.
Power up the laptop and go back to working on a clean and new looking screen :)

Apple introduced the 13 inch (technically 13.3"") MacBook Air at the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2008 as the thinnest notebook available at that time at 1.9 cm. The laptop included an antiglare backlit LED display and a trackpad that responded to various touch gestures.

A second generation MacBook Air 13” was released in October 2010. This updated version included a tapered frame, increased screen resolution, a standard SSD, two USB ports, and stereo speakers.

In October 2018, the third generation MacBook Air 13” was released, with a decreased thickness of 15.6mm and weight of 2.75 pounds. It included a Retina display with a resolution of 2560×1600 pixels, Amber Lake processors, Touch ID, and two combined USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports. The tapered frame originally introduced in the second generation is continued in the third generation. It comes in three colors: silver, space gray, and gold.

## Step 1
The iPad Pro was water-damaged and then won't turn on. Press the power button. The iPad Pro won't turn on. Connect the iPad Pro to power and the iPad Pro still won't turn on.


## Step 2
Next, we need to disassemble the iPad Pro for testing. Put the iPad Pro on the Heating Pad to heat.
When the temperature reaches about 70 °C, separate the screen with a Pry Piece. Please pay attention to the angle and direction to avoid damaging the flex cables.


## Step 3
Then we remove screws on the shielding cover with a Screwdriver. Detach the shielding cover. Disconnect the flex cables.
Continue to remove screws on the shielding cover of motherboard and then the shielding cover.
Insert a Pry Piece between the battery and motherboard. Disconnect the battery.",Repair_an_iPad_Pro_That_Won't_Power_On,211
Repair_an_iPad_Pro_That_Won't_Power_On_1,"## Step 4
Then we check if the boot current of the motherboard is normal. Power up the motherboard with a Direct Current Supply. When the probes touch the main power supply circuit of the motherboard and the boot-up hasn't been triggered, the current directly jumps to 2.7 A.
We can confirm that the main power supply circuit of the motherboard is short-circuited, leading to the not turning on issue. Then we measure the diode values of the main power supply circuit with diode mode of the multimeter. The diode value is 534, which is normal.
When measuring a nearby capacitor, the diode value is 0. It indicates that the circuit is shorted.",Repair_an_iPad_Pro_That_Won't_Power_On,151
Repair_an_iPad_Pro_That_Won't_Power_On_2,"## Step 5
Since there are too many related components on the circuit, we use rosin detecting to find the short-circuited component. The Rosin Dispenser is used to dispense rosin this time. Compared to the traditional soldering iron, the operation is easier with better effect.
Then we apply a voltage of 3 V to the motherboard. It can be seen under the microscope that rosin on a capacitor has melted. We can judge that the capacitor is damaged.
The next thing we need to do is to remove the capacitor. Remove the capacitor with Hot Air Gun at 340 °C and airflow 3. Please protect the surrounding battery while heating to avoid damage.


## Step 6
After the motherboard has cooled, measure with multimeter again. The diode value returns to a normal value of 156.
Because the main power supply circuit of the motherboard is short-circuited, the battery is protected.
Then we use the Direct Current Supply to activate the battery Firstly, clean the motherboard with PCB Cleaner.",Repair_an_iPad_Pro_That_Won't_Power_On,222

Remove the Pry Piece. Apply a voltage of 4.2 V to the main power supply circuit to activate the battery.
Next, we assemble the iPad Pro for testing. Install the screws and shielding cover. Before installing the screen, we need to remove the double-sided tape on the screen and rear cover housing.
Then we apply new double-sided tape. Install the display.


## Step 8
Turn on the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro turns on normally and the fault has been cleared. The screen of the iPad Pro shows a sign of water damage. Because the customer is unwilling to replace the screen, our repair can go so far.

Follow this guide to replace the thermal paste in your iPad Pro.

***This guide applies to iPad models with a copper tape logic board shield.***

The processor in your iPad Pro might be small, but it can generate a lot of heat. Thermal paste helps transfer the heat away from the processor, so it can be dissipated elsewhere.

If you removed the logic board shield from your iPad Pro, you'll need to replace the thermal paste. Your iPad Pro will work without thermal paste. However, it will overheat and may slow down to keep itself cool. Reusing thermal paste is better than nothing, but should only be done if you don't have access to new thermal paste.

Apply new thermal paste to keep your iPad Pro working safely and at full capacity.


###Tools Required:

 - Arctic Silver Thermal Paste

 - Spudger

 - ESD Safe Blunt Nose Tweezers

 - Cotton Swabs

 - Isopropyl Alcohol (90% or Greater)


###Parts Required:

 - Tesa 61395 Double-Sided Tape


## Clean the processor
Use a spudger to scrape away the old thermal paste from the processor.
Don't use metal tools to scrape away thermal paste, as this will scratch the processor.
Use a cotton swab or lint-free cloth with high-strength (>90%) isopropyl alcohol to clean any remaining thermal paste.",iPad_Pro_Thermal_Paste_Replacement,296
iPad_Pro_Thermal_Paste_Replacement_1,"## Clean the logic board shield
Repeat the previous step for the logic board shield.


## Apply new thermal paste
Apply a rice grain-sized amount of thermal paste to the middle of the processor.


## Apply Tesa tape
Apply [link|https://www.ifixit.com/products/tesa-61395-tape?variant=40026630127719|new_window=true|Tesa tape] along the edges of the logic board shield.


## Install the logic board shield
Be very careful during this step! The Tesa tape is very sticky, and the shield can't be repositioned once it sticks.
Use [product|IF145-020|tweezers] or your fingers to remove the protective paper lining from the Tesa tape.
Align the shield over the logic board in the correct orientation.
Lay the shield over the logic board.


## Secure the shield to the logic board
Slide your finger along the perimeter of the shield to secure it to the logic board.
Don't press on the shield where the thermal paste is. When you install the iPad screen, it will press against the shield and spread the paste over the processor.

Then we disconnect the display.
Remove the battery screw on the motherboard.
To prevent the circuit from burning out, insert a pry piece to block the battery from the motherboard.


## Step 3
Install a known-good display. The screen still won’t respond to touch. It can be judged that the unresponsive problem is not caused by a damaged display. The motherboard fault has resulted in the problem. In the first place, we check the touch connectors to see if they are deformed or damaged.

Open the circuit diagram. The three pins are connected to the chip through one inductor.
Measure the resistance value of circuit connecting the inductor to the chip. The value is normal.


## Step 5
Then measure the resistance value of another end connecting the inductor to the touch connector. The value is abnormal.
Therefore, it can be judged that the inductor is damaged.
A damaged inductor is generally caused by improper operation that involves installing the display while the battery is connected to the motherboard. So we must disconnect the battery firstly when we install the display.
Next, we replace the inductor. Pry the motherboard slightly to prevent the heat from dissipating fast.",iPad_Pro_Touch_Screen_Not_Working_/Unresponsive_Screen_Problem_Repair_Technique,196

because of the finely broken glass, be sure to wear safety glasses (you only have one pair of eyes and they cannot be replaced). Think about protective gloves if you need to.
Additionally: cosmetic sticks and some isopropanol (100ml is enough), [product|IF145-020|tweezers] (pincetce), a PH00 star screwdriver, a piece of thin plastic to disconnect the battery pins and a soft guitar pick - it will be perfect.
Small plastic blade will come in handy. The piece of plastic I wrote about above must be really thin but quite stiff. You can use a piece of neatly cut paper from a school notebook (non-conductive).",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,196
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_2,"## removing a damaged screen and display - step #1
it is easiest to start from the place marked with a yellow circle. Then, along the purple arrows on both sides. Absolutely stop before the bottom edge!
in the place marked with a red rectangle there is a tape from the Home button and the Touch.ID function - ( attached to the glass ) You can't damage it (this item is unique)
a drop of isopropanol and a spatula or a thin, flat screwdriver will certainly help to overcome the every next few inches.
with a yellow circle I mark the Touch.ID tape which is running from the digitizer under the matrix. This bend is sensitive.",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,144
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_3,"## removing a damaged screen and display - step #2
do not try to peel the button tape off the digitizer at this stage. There is a shortcut that will give you a lot of space for further work
My matrix is broken, I don't care about it. If yours works and you are not going to replace it - ***do not touch the display surface (black). Fingerprints are very difficult to remove.*** alternatively, you can use nitrile protective gloves (like me)
the shortcut I'm talking about is disconnecting the entire assembly. To do this, disconnect the battery voltage and remove the matrix and digitizer with the Touch.ID button tape
with red circles I mark the screws fixing the matrix


## removing a damaged screen and display - step #3
the northern screws are covered by isolator tape. Gently peel off (do not tear it - you will need it) until the screw is exposed. South screws may be covered by the black glue, don't worry about it. Just unscrew the screws - the glue will give slightly.
unscrewed matrix (4 screws) slightly lift it by the northern edge. Pay attention to the signal tapes connected to the motherboard",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,264

My matrix is broken, I don't care about it. If yours works and you are not going to replace it - ***do not touch the display surface (black). Fingerprints are very difficult to remove.***
when you lift the matrix, under you will see the motherboard and connected battery. The red circle I marked a power supply piont, which should be disconnected at first. The yellow circle I marked the connection of the digitizer and screen to the motherboard.
the safest way to remove power from the motherboard is separating a power connector. You can do this by slipping a thin non-conductive layer between the power pins (especially the negative ones).
caution - too thick separating layer can lead to mechanical damage of pins and side current contacts. This is the most common tablet failure caused by unqualified personnel of unauthorized repair shops.",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,192
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_5,"## removing a damaged screen and display - step #5
after unscrewing the cover you will see three fastened connectors: two parallel - it's digitizer and one perpendicular - it's a matrix. Unclip the connectors and remove the matrix. If it is damaged, as in my case, it should be utilized of. If it works and you're not going to replace it, make sure you put it away in a safe place.
caution - do not touch the display surface (black). Fingerprints are very difficult to remove.
a few more wires and one flat strip remain connected. Unless you're going to remove the motherboard (I don't see a need to do so in this case) you don't need to worry about it. Only the flat tape remains important - it's a tape of Home button and the Touch.ID function


## Touch.ID button & tape extraction - part #1
the connector is a bit different than you have already seen in this device. Peel off the protective tape and pry the lock bar on the opposite side of the tape.
remove the tape from the unlocked port, peel it off the case and put it aside.",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,248
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_6,"## Touch.ID button & tape extraction - part #2
finally managed to disconnect the digitizer from the tablet. You can skip the next 10 and 11 steps if your digitizer is in one piece. If it's broken into thousands of pieces (like mine) read it carefully
the entire home button strip consists of several connected sections (some with a bit of electronics on board), a clicking button and an additional bracket that is absolutely necessary for proper operation.
the whole set consists of 3 elements: a tape with a button, a metal bracked and a button-sized round washer (in my case it was glued to the body of the button). Make sure the washer is not left on the glass. Thoroughly clean the entire assembly of fine glass debris and dirts.
glass particles left on the button elements will scratch and crack the new digitizer glass over time. Make sure everything, including the edge of the tablet, has been properly cleaned of glass particles and dirt.


## Touch.ID button & tape extraction - part #3
be extremely careful at this stage. Remove any speck of glass from the adhesive surfaces or remove all remaining adhesive with a cotton swab and isopropanol.
glass particles left on the button elements will scratch and crack the new digitizer glass over time. Make sure everything, including the edge of the tablet, has been properly cleaned of glass particles and dirt.",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,292
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_7,"## Cleaning of everything
particles of broken glass left on the contact surface of the housing, new digitizer glass and button tape under pressure will lead to scratches and subsequent cracks on the surface of the new digitizer glass. Make sure that the surfaces are absolutely clean and free of anything
don't forget to clear the table you're working on. Leftover particles of broken glass can scratch the case in a really ugly way",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,87
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_8,"## test assembly
unfortunately, this step is necessary. More and more often we buy non-original spare parts (mainly due to the price but also due to the lack of availability of genuine spare parts). These, especially Chinese ones, are often incomplete or not working.
Connect the whole new set to the tablet and test their operation. If you do not peel off the protective films, you can easily return the purchased non-working items and request a replacement or refund. If the technical film is removed earlier, dishonest sellers try to blame us - the owners of the devices for installation faults
don't forget to remove the battery protection layer that has been inserted between the pins of the motherboard and the battery. Tighten the screw in the port to make sure you have full contact.
check the operation of the new elements, especially the entire touch layer. If you notice ""dead lines"", disconnect the digitizer and return it to your seller. Don't forget to remove the securing screw from the battery port beforehand and use the motherboard and battery pins protection",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,220
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_9,"## bending digitizer tapes
place the digitizer on a clean surface in front of you. Note that the inner touch side also has a clear protective film on it. Gently bend the area around the connection tapes (so as not to stick the tape to the foil but to the proper screen)
remove the tape protecting the adhesive on the tapes from the inside. This side should stick to the digitizer glass.
gently bend the tape to the surface of the digitizer. The glue is not very strong but should be enough for a moment. Cover the glued tape with the previously removed digitizer protective film (in the previous point). This will stop the tape from peeling off
do not press the adhesive tape. The concentrated connection paths of the entire digitizer in this place are less than 1mm. It's a really delicate and sensitive place. Pressing (possibly breaking) may cause dead lines on the touch surface (after all, it worked during the previous test :-) )",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,201
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_10,"## Home button installation - part #1
place the button in the intended place. Make sure once again that you have removed all possible dirt and particles from the glass of the previous digitizer
lead the cable along the edge of the digitizer layer in the left direction - parallel to the bottom edge of the screen. Whether the tape will overlap the digizer level (a layer with copper mini-wires) depends on the construction of the replacement shield itself. In the original ones there is room to leave a 0.5mm gap.
In my case, the button tape overlaps 0.5mm on the digitizer. Everything is OK.
put the home button bracket in the right place and stick it. In the original, the braket is additionally secured with a thin layer of hot glue


## Home button installation - part #2
mount the metal Home button bracket  so that the round distance corresponds to the micro-switch of the button - which is important for proper work of entire button (click function)
stick the rest of the button tape to the glass. In the case (like mine) where the screen adhesive is already placed on the inside of the glass, make sure that you do not stick the button to the film protecting the adhesive. Lift the foil protecting the adhesive and glue the button elements under it.",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,269
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_11,"## final assembly - part #1
it's almost done :) Apply glue to the edge of the screen or the edge of the housing (depending on the type). If you already bought a screen with glue (like me) go to the next step.
Make sure you haven't lost the battery pin spacer that cuts off power to the motherboard.
a support for the screen would be useful - place the screen perpendicular to the housing and connect the Home button ribbon.


## final assembly - part #2
make sure once again that the plastic piece separating the battery pins from the motherboard is in the right place. Without this, the electronics of the tablet may be damaged when touching connecting
connect the digitizer (double plugs). The connection ribbons should be bent towards the inside of the tablet. When closing, tapes should push themselves under the edge of the housing.
set the matrix perpendicular to the housing and plug the connector into the port. You can screw a connecrors bracket. Remove the plastic cover of the battery port and replace the screw - it's time to test.


## final assembly - part #3
put the elements back in the right place, but do not tear off the foil protecting the glue and the surface of the screen. Check the operation of the screen, touch and button. If everything works, go to the next step",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,280
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_12,"## final assembly - part #4
set the matrix in the right place and screw in the securing screws (marked with a green arrow). If the holes are not blocked, you can pierce the membranes with a thin screwdriver or other tool.


## final assembly - part #5
remove the protective film of the screen adhesive
remove the protective film of the digitizer
remove the protective film of the matrix (remember
remember that you cannot touch the surface without the protective film. The resulting fingerprints and marks will be very difficult to remove",iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement,111
iPad_9_(2021)_Screen_and_Touch_Glass_(WiFi_&_Cellular)_Replacement_13,"## final assembly - part #6
set the tablet right edge up (do not stick yet). Closing the screen from this side, you will notice how the connecting strips slide under the edge of the housing. If you feel that they are curling ON THE EDGE - stop, go back to step - 17 -  and adjust the position of the straps.
If the tapes have hidden under the edge, close the screen and press down lightly. The glue is strong enough to hold the digitizer to the edge. You don't have to use force.
Check the operation of the touch and the aesthetics of the entire connection (screen - aluminum edge of the tablet). I hope you are satisfied with your work.
''Congratulations - you have just replaced the screen and digitizer in your favorite tablet on your own kitchen table (according to the mission of [link|http://studionapraw.pl |new_window=true|studionapraw.pl] :) ''
***I know it wasn't easy, but you just saved a lot of money. Replacing the screen and digitizer in most repair shops costs from $ 150-200.***
