"iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement_0","# iPhone ""L-Shaped"" Battery Adhesive Strips Replacement
Use this guide to correctly apply replacement battery adhesive strips for ""***L-shaped***"" iPhone batteries, including the dual-cell batteries in the iPhone X and XS Max, and the single-cell battery in the iPhone XS. Use the list below to check if your phone is compatible.

If your replacement battery doesn't come with adhesive strips pre-installed, or you're reusing your existing battery, these strips must be replaced. The strips are easily damaged if not applied correctly, so you may want to have a spare set of strips on hand when following this guide for the first time.

These adhesive strips are different from those in prior-generation iPhones due to the presence of the wireless charging coil. The coil lies directly underneath the battery, which is secured with four adhesive strips that are contoured around the coil to avoid damaging it.

Before you begin, you should have removed the battery by following a guide like the ones linked below:","iPhone_""L-Shaped""_Battery_Adhesive_Strips_Replacement",216,battery,False

Use this guide to revive your iPhone SE 2020’s battery life and performance with a new battery. If your battery is swollen, [[What to do with a swollen battery|take appropriate precautions|new_window=true]].

This guide instructs you to completely detach the display assembly; this is intended to prevent accidental damage to the display cables. If you feel comfortable removing the battery without putting undue strain on the display cables, you can skip the steps for detaching the display. Additionally, while it’s possible to remove the adhesive strips securing the battery as soon as you open the phone, this guide recommends first removing the Taptic Engine. Doing so reduces the risk of breaking the lower adhesive strips accidentally, either by snagging them on the Taptic Engine, or by pulling the strips at too sharp of an angle.

For optimal performance, after completing this guide, [[Battery Calibration|calibrate]] your newly installed battery: Charge it to 100% and keep charging it for at least two more hours. Then use your iPhone until it shuts off due to low battery. Finally, charge it uninterrupted to 100%.

iPhone_6s_Plus_iSight_Camera_Replacement_3,"## Step 2
Opening the display on the 6s Plus separates a thin strip of adhesive around the perimeter of the display. If you prefer to replace the adhesive, have a set of new adhesive strips ready before you continue. It's possible to complete the repair without replacing the adhesive, and you probably won't notice any difference in functionality.
Apply a suction cup to the lower left corner of the display assembly.
If your display is badly cracked, [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Taping+Over+The+Display/103487|covering it with a layer of clear packing tape|new_window=true] may allow the suction cup to adhere. Alternatively, very strong tape may be used instead of the suction cup. If all else fails, you can superglue the suction cup to the broken screen.

iPhone_8_Screen_Replacement_5,"## Heat the display
The next three steps show how to separate the screen using a suction cup.
Heating the lower edge of the iPhone will help soften the adhesive securing the display, making it easier to open.
Use a hairdryer or [https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iOpener+Heating/25705|prepare an iOpener|new_window=true] and apply it to the lower edge of the phone for about 90 seconds in order to soften up the adhesive underneath.


## Separate the display
Apply a suction cup to the lower half of the front panel, just above the home button.
Be sure the suction cup does not overlap with the home button, as this will prevent a seal from forming between the suction cup and front glass.


## Step 6
Pull up on the suction cup with firm, constant pressure to create a slight gap between the screen and the frame.
Insert an opening pick into the gap.
The watertight adhesive holding the screen in place is very strong; creating this initial gap takes a significant amount of force.

Continue peeling away the liner from the adhesive, gently pressing the adhesive into place.
If you've correctly aligned the adhesive, the edges will fall perfectly into place.
If your adhesive is slightly misaligned, gently pull the long edges into alignment with the frame.
If the adhesive begins to crease or wrinkle, remove it and start over with fresh adhesive.
If you don't have another set of adhesive strips handy, it's okay to temporarily put your iPhone back together and use it normally without any adhesive. Just keep in mind that your iPhone's water resistance will be compromised until you replace the adhesive.


## Step 8
Use a spudger to press the adhesive around the entire perimeter of your iPhone.
Work around the fragile grounding clips. If you bend one out of place, gently bend it back with your fingers or tweezers.
Don't press too hard, or you'll stretch and deform the adhesive.",iPhone_16_Pro_Max_Battery_Replacement,211,case,False

Make sure the suction cup is firmly attached to the front panel assembly.
While holding the iPhone down with one hand, pull up on the suction cup to slightly separate the front panel assembly from the rear case.
Take your time and apply firm, constant force. The screen is a much tighter fit than most devices.
With a plastic opening tool, begin to gently pry the rear case down, away from the screen, while you pull up with the suction cup.
There are several clips attaching the front panel assembly to the rear case, so you may need to use a combination of the suction cup and plastic opening tool to free the front panel assembly.

## Opening up the phone
Open the iPhone by swinging the home button end of the front panel assembly away from the rear case, using the top of the phone as a hinge.
Several clips along the top edge of the front panel form a partial hinge.
During reassembly, align the clips just below the top edge of the rear case. Then, slide the front panel upward until its top edge is flush with that of the rear case.


## Step 5
Open the display to about a 90º angle, and lean it against something to keep it propped up while you're working on the phone.

Screwdriver_Best_Practices_2,"## Size Selection
A correctly sized driver should “fill up” the screw head, utilizing both the full depth and width of the socket.
Beginners commonly make the mistake of using a driver that’s too small. An undersized driver slips easily, damaging the screw head and making it difficult to turn afterward—even with a correctly-sized driver. This is known as a ''stripped screw''.
An oversized driver fits into the screw only shallowly, if at all.
When you find a driver that fits about right, compare the next size up as well as the next size down before you proceed.
In general, use the largest driver size that fits snugly into the screw.


## Proper Use
Keep your drivers in good working condition by using them only as designed.
Avoid using screwdrivers as improvised pry tools or chisels.
Prying with a screwdriver can bend or break the tip, making it useless for turning screws.
Chiseling with a driver can deform the tip. A damaged driver like this one no longer fits snugly in the screw head, resulting in slippage (and stripped screws).
To avoid stripping screws, only use drivers that are in good condition.",Screwdriver_Best_Practices,254,unknown,False

It’s well known that there are many videos and articles about dismantling the iPhone 11 Pro Max by teardown masters. From those teardown videos and articles, we know that the glass back of the iPhone 11 Pro Max is the toughest glass that Apple uses. If the back glass of the phone is broken, we have to remove all the components to fix it. It is very troublesome and difficult for some repairers to refurbish the phone, especially because of the triple lens camera system, which makes it much more difficult to repair the glass.

So, is there a useful and practical method to overcome this repair problem that ''doesn’t'' damage the OLED display?

There are many methods you may have attempted, including hot separation, frozen separation and more, but with little success.
